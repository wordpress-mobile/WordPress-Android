14.1:
- Block Editor: a new Shortcode block lets you create and edit shortcodes, weâ€™ve reduced the padding around text-based blocks, and editing very long posts is now a more stable experience.
- Updates: The option to remove a Jetpack site from the site picker has been disabled.
- Bug fixes: searches for posts omitted some results. Now searching works as intended!
