17.4:
We’ve added 3 new updates to Stories in this update:

You’ll now see a media picker when adding a Story block from the block editor, making it easier to get started.

Story previews now render as expected in the Reader.

And finally, when slides fail to upload, the app will automatically retry, saving you an extra tap!
