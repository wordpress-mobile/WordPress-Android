* Block Editor improvements: You’ll see clearer error messages when a block contains invalid content, and an issue in link settings (“Open in New Tab” was always OFF on open) is fixed.
* Better offline support: If you draft a page while offline, the app will automatically upload it to the server as soon as an internet connection is available.
