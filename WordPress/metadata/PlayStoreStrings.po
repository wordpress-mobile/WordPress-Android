"Why WordPress?\n"
"\n"
"There are a lot of blogging services, website builders, and social networks out there. Why create your website with WordPress?\n"
"\n"
"WordPress powers over a third of the web. It’s used by hobby blogs, businesses of all sizes, online stores, even the biggest news sites on the internet. Odds are that many of your favorite websites are running on WordPress.\n"
"\n"
"With WordPress, you own your own content. Other social networks treat you as a commodity, and assume ownership of the content you post. But with WordPress anything you publish is yours, and you can take it with you wherever you’d like.\n"
"\n"
"Whether you need a website builder to create your website, or a simple blog maker, WordPress can help. It gives you beautiful designs, powerful features, and the freedom to build anything you want.\n"
