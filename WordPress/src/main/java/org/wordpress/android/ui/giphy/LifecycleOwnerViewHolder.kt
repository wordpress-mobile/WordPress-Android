/**
 * A [ViewHolder] that is also a [LifecycleOwner]
 *
 * This allows subclasses to observe [LiveData] objects:
 *
 * ```
 * mediaViewModel?.isSelected?.observe(this, Observer {
 *     // do something
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * The observers will be automatically removed on 2 occasions:
 *
 * - When the [ViewHolder.itemView]'s parent ([RecyclerView]) is removed from the window
 * - When the [ViewHolder] is bound with a different item. See [bind].
 *
 * For this to work, subclasses should make use of [bind] when binding items (i.e. ViewModels). For example, in a
 * [ListAdapter]:
 *
 * ```
 * override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: MyViewHolder, position: Int) {
 *     holder.bind(getItem(position))
 * }
 * ```
 * The subclass should make sure to call `super.bind()`:
 *
 * ```
 * class MyViewHolder(itemView: View): LifecycleOwnerViewHolder<MyItem> {
 *     override fun bind(item: MyItem?) {
 *         super.bind(item)
 *
 *         // observe LiveData here
 *     }
 * }
 * ```

     * 3. itemView `onViewAttachedToWindow` -- state is STARTED

     * The 2nd step causes all observers to be removed and even if the view is shown (attached) again. This leaves us
     * with a [ViewHolder] that does not react to anything anymore.
     *
     * Only removing when the parent [RecyclerView] is probably not ideal but it solves the problem of observers
     * leaking even if the [RecyclerView] and [ViewHolder] have been removed from the window.
