     * by the SYNC_PUBLISHING feature flag. The function is used to generate the final RemotePostPayload
     * that is sent to the backend through PostActionBuilder.newPushPostAction(). By setting the
     * shouldSkipConflictResolutionCheck = true, "if_not_modified_since" is not sent to server and the post overwrites
     * the remote version.
     *
     * Until pages conflict resolution is complete, we need to set shouldSkipConflictResolutionCheck = true for pages.
