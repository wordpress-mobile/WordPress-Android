 * passing a default locale to it. Instead of littering the code with a lot of suppressed lint calls, this wrapper is
 * created so we can suppress it in one place. Hopefully we can remove this method soon and just replace all the callers
 * with the [String.capitalize] call.
 *
 * The [capitalizeWithLocaleWithoutLint] is chosen to communicate this issue with the caller.
