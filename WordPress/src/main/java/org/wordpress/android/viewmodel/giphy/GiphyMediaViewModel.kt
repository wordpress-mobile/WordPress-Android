 * only keep a minimal amount of memory. This also hides the complexity of navigating the values of [Media].
 *
 * This class also houses the selection status. The [GiphyMediaViewHolder] observes the [isSelected] and
 * [selectionNumber] properties to update itself.
 *
 * See the [Giphy API docs](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/) for more information on what a [Media] object contains.
 * Search for "The GIF Object" section.
