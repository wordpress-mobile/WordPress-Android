/**
 * A base class for implementing Android [ViewModel] classes that also act as a [CoroutineScope].
 *
 * One advantage of using this is that coroutine builders like [async] or [launch] will become children of the parent
 * [coroutineJob] declared in this [ViewModel]. If this [ViewModel] is cleared from memory, all the active child
 * coroutines will be automatically cancelled.
 *
 * This strategy is called _Structured Concurrency_. Learn more about it here:

 * - [Structured concurrency, lifecycle and coroutine parent-child hierarchy](https://goo.gl/rH3rmt)
