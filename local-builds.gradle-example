/*
This file is completely optional, but its usage makes it easier to work with libraries
in local path. This example file needs to be copied as `local-builds.gradle` to take
effect.

`settings.gradle` will check these properties and if the given path is valid, it'll include it
in the project and substitute the binary dependency with the local one.

Once this file is updated Gradle will need to re-configure the project. (sync)

Please note that some included builds may be slow to compile. Specifically, as of Sep 25, 2020,
making a change to FluxC can take around 2 minutes to build. This is something that'll hopefully
get better with some build improvements, but in the meantime it might be best to prefer the
binary build if you're not working on a specific library.
