Miller<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In 2019, Marvel Comics was getting ready to celebrate its 80th anniversary. It had begun as Timely Comics, and quickly came to dominate the landscape with superheroes like the Human Torch and Namor the Submariner; now, for a special graphic-novel collection, the publisher invited superstar writer Art Spiegelman to write an introduction reflecting on Marvel&#8217;s legacy. There was just one issue: They asked him to compromise his own legacy to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Spiegelman is best known for his independent graphic novel <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Maus,<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> which retold his father\u2019s experience surviving the Holocaust. Yet, when he compared then-president Donald Trump to the Red Skull, the fascist supervillain leader of a Nazi organization known as Hydra, Marvel balked. Demanding that a Jewish writer revise his material for the sake of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2019\/aug\/16\/art-spiegelmans-marvel-essay-refused-publication-for-orange-skull-trump-dig\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">remaining apolitical<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> felt particularly disingenuous, given that Captain America made his 1941 debut punching Hitler in the face on the cover of his first issue<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. Over the years, Marvel writers had used superheroes to explore myriad political and social issues \u2014 sometimes explicitly, sometimes by merely existing. The success of 2018\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> and the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2018\/12\/28\/18159102\/spidersona-fan-art-spiderverse\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Spidersona trend<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> that followed it, attests to the positive impact diverse representation can have on audiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Superhero comics aren\u2019t <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">only<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> political, but they\u2019ve nearly always been political. Since Superman\u2019s debut first made the genre mainstream, superheroes and their stories have advocated for social justice. And while some writers (and the corporations that employ them) may have lost sight of this reality, the communities these heroes represent can see when the forces that be abdicate the responsibility the heroes gladly shoulder. The essays collected below explore how superhero comics capture the lived experiences of marginalized communities \u2014 as well as how some comics have only served to stigmatize them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2019\/aug\/17\/art-spiegelman-golden-age-superheroes-were-shaped-by-the-rise-of-fascism?src=longreads\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Golden Age Superheroes Were Shaped By the Rise of Fascism<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (Art Spiegelman, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Guardian<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, August 2019)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In recalling the origins of the superhero genre, Spiegelman stresses that the immaturity often ascribed to comic books was as prevalent in the 1930s as it is in the present. If there\u2019s any notable difference, it likely lies in the fact that publishers themselves were aware of this and consequently chose not to prioritize making the high-quality products we see today. (\u201cJust give them a lot of action and don\u2019t use too many words,\u201d publisher Martin Goodman once told Stan Lee.) Though Superman\u2019s debut shifted the medium by introducing an archetype that captured the hearts (and dimes) of millions of readers, the sentiment that comic books were for immature audiences endured. But the adventures of these heroes and the lives of the creators who made them tell a different tale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Bold as it was to introduce Captain America by having him punch Hitler on the cover of his first issue in 1941, the impact of his debut is better appreciated if you understand how tolerant the U.S. was toward Nazi sympathizers until the country properly entered World War II. Just two years prior to Cap\u2019s debut, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/codeswitch\/2019\/02\/20\/695941323\/when-nazis-took-manhattan\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">thousands of members of the German American Bund rallied in New York to express their approval of Hitler\u2019s antisemitic sentiments<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. The sales of superhero comics began to dwindle after the war, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">which not only suggests that consumers were aware of their political nature, but implies that publishers were willing to exploit those politics for profit.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The pioneers behind this embryonic medium based in New York were predominantly Jewish and from ethnic minority backgrounds. It wasn\u2019t just Siegel and Shuster, but a whole generation of recent immigrants and their children \u2013 those most vulnerable to the ravages of the great depression \u2013 who were especially attuned to the rise of virulent antisemitism in Germany. They created the American\u00a0\u00dcbermenschen\u00a0who fought for a nation that would at least nominally welcome \u201cyour tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/superman-is-jewish-the-hebrew-roots-of-americas-greatest-superhero?src=longreads\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Superman is Jewish: The Hebrew Roots of America\u2019s Greatest Superhero<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (Rich Goldstein, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Daily Beast<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, July 2017)<\/span><\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"sidenote\"><p>Much of Michael Chabon\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.penguinrandomhouse.com\/books\/25713\/the-amazing-adventures-of-kavalier-and-clay-with-bonus-content-by-michael-chabon\/\"><em>The Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Klay<\/em><\/a> is based on the lives of Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, Stan Lee, and other comic-book creators.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Straight to the point, Goldstein opens his essay by making an important observation: Superman owes his stranger-in-a-strange-land origin to the Jewish heritage of his creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. But his roots are often overshadowed by his association with American culture. Contemporary comics frequently depict Superman with American iconography, even though he\u2019s repeatedly acted as a hero for Earth and beyond. So it\u2019s not surprising to think that readers would try to compare him to Jesus Christ, given the important role that Christianity plays within traditional American values. Yet, hyper-fixating on Clark\u2019s Christlike attributes serves to obfuscate the superhero\u2019s Jewish origins.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Here was a being who had immigrated to a land that supposedly offered the prospects of a better life, and changed his name (Kal-El to Clark Kent) to do so\u00a0 \u2014 just as some Jewish families who immigrated to the U.S. changed their names to avoid prejudice. Goldstein posits that the antisemitic sentiments of the time would have gotten Superman\u2019s comic cancelled before it even began, and invites the reader to question how warmly the character would have been received if his Jewish influences were more explicit. More importantly, however, his article affirms the fact that the creation of Superman \u2014 and the rise of the superhero genre \u2014 should be credited to the imaginations of Jewish creators who produced a hero that stood against the oppression they faced.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Superman is as American as apple pie, in that both have their origins in the Middle East. Apples, because they are thought to have been first domesticated in Turkey, and Superman, because of his oftentimes overlooked Jewish heritage.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.syfy.com\/syfy-wire\/house-of-xpower-of-x-moves-mutants-forward?src=longreads\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">House of X \/ Power of X Moves Mutants Forward<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (Stephanie Williams, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">SYFY<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, January 2020)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Even those largely unfamiliar with superhero comics are likely aware of the X-Men. But before the blockbuster sales and long-running film franchise, the beloved mutants came to prominence thanks to the efforts of Len Wein, who created characters like Storm and Wolverine, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nymag.com\/nymetro\/arts\/features\/3522\/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Chris Claremont<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, who confronted them with dilemmas that blurred the traditional lines of good and evil. At the heart of the franchise\u2019s moral ambiguity is the ideological schism between the X-Men founder Charles Xavier<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:400;\">(Professor X), who seeks to protect mutants and mankind despite the latter\u2019s extreme prejudices against the former, and Erik Lensherr (Magneto), who prioritizes the well-being of mutants above all else. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.history.com\/news\/stan-lee-x-men-civil-rights-inspiration\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The duo has often been compared to Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X for the characters&#8217; respective beliefs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, but since the X-Men were created any significant strides toward the dreams of either camp have been brief \u2014 if they existed at all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">That changed in 2019 with the debut of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2019\/8\/22\/20828371\/house-of-x-powers-of-x-comics-reviews-spoilers-jonathan-hickman\"><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">House of X \/ Powers of X<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. Spearheaded by creators Jonathan Hickman, Pepe Larraz, and R.B. Silva, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">HOXPOX<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> offered mutants a way forward that appeased both Xavier\u2019s accomodationism and Lensherr\u2019s hardline approach: separation. The first issue lays out a broad-based mutant-led effort to create a culture detached from mankind. As Williams notes in her review, part of the appeal of the comic\u2019s premise lies in the fact that mutants finally \u201cget out of their own way\u201d; recognizing how paralyzed they\u2019ve been, they acknowledge that the only way to advance is to de-center the desires of the community that so despised them. Three years after their new culture\u2019s founding, the mutants still face opponents bent on their destruction. The difference now is that extinction no longer lurks in every defeat. On the contrary, every victory against those who seek to destroy them asserts that they, and the marginalized communities they\u2019ve been thought to represent, owe nothing to their oppressors when it comes to their survival.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The safety and future for all mutants becomes the only goal, and there is no trying to continue to convince humans they are worthy of occupying the same space. It\u2019s proven time and time again to be lethal to incorporate humans into their plans. The focus is now Krakoa and making sure it remains a place where mutants can truly be free \u2014 all mutants, not just the ones who adhere to a specific ideology. There are still mutants who lose their lives in order to secure the future of Krakoa, but at least it&#8217;s for the greater good and not for selfish men.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\u2018<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/aiptcomics.com\/2021\/08\/19\/house-of-m-essay\/?src=longreads\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">House of M\u2019 and the Vilification of Mental Illness<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (Lia Williamson, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">AIPT Comics<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, August 2021)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">While Wanda Maximoff\u2019s popularity has certainly been bolstered by her appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, her character has a deep history within the Marvel comics. Introduced in the first issues of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">X-Men<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, Wanda (Scarlet Witch) was originally a villain operating with her brother Pietro (Quicksilver) as a member of Magneto\u2019s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Over the decades, however, her allegiances changed, and she became a prominent member of the Avengers. Like most other characters, she\u2019s gone through her fair share of ups and downs over the course of the past few decades, but none quite compare to the hardships she faced during the 2005 event <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">House of M<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Most Marvel comics fans recall the event as the time when Wanda experiences a mental breakdown and loses control of her reality-changing powers. The consequences for these episodes are dire: She\u2019s manipulated into creating an alternate reality where mutants aren\u2019t hated, and subsequently depowers nearly all mutants when that reality is compromised. While all superhero parties involved were aware of Wanda\u2019s poor mental state and how she was manipulated, since the comic\u2019s release she has shouldered most of the blame for the tragedy. By dissecting the story, Williamson opens a dialogue regarding the treatment of the mentally ill in comics \u2014 and concludes that, much like Professor X and Magneto\u2019s ideological conflict, there is rarely an effort made to properly address the issues. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">House of M<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> failed Wanda on multiple levels: narratively, because it suggested that for all the crises the world\u2019s mightiest heroes faced, they were helpless to support one of their own; and conceptually, because it places the onus of the fallout on a character who was robbed of her agency.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><em>House of M<\/em>\u00a0is a low point for Wanda and how comics deal with the topic of mental illness overall, vilifying a woman\u2019s mental breakdown by having her virtually wipe out a species (one she also belonged to in 2005, mind you) and kill several of her own teammates. The story strips her of her own agency while making her the sole bad guy left to pick up the pieces years later. It\u2019s a story that says the mentally ill are dangerous, that we\u2019re capable of horrible things and maybe we\u00a0should\u00a0be \u201cput down\u201d before those things can happen.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/aiptcomics.com\/2022\/06\/07\/pride-month-queer-representation-essay\/?src=longreads\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">On Queer Superhero A-Listers and a Lack of Visibility<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (Madeleine Chan, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">AIPT Comics<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, June 2022)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">One of the most notable examples of comic book media to emerge in the pandemic has been the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/07\/27\/arts\/marvel-x-men-podcast-cerebro.html\"><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Cerebro<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> podcast<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. Hosted by literary agent Connor Goldsmith, each episode welcomes a guest to talk about the many characters of the X-Men franchise. These discussions often entail a discussion of the queer subtext at work throughout the characters\u2019 histories (since explicit queerness was traditionally taboo in mainstream comics). In the past decade, one of the benefits of the increased push for diverse representation in comics has been increased visibility for queer characters. As Chan notes in this piece, both major and minor characters have been confirmed as queer either by their creators or within their comics \u2014 which raises the question of why there\u2019s been so little effort to do the same for the major characters in their film and television incarnations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But our world is no utopia, and so Chan\u2019s essay raises the issue of how exactly queer characters are being portrayed in their respective comics. They note the cancellation of Al Ewing\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Guardians of the Galaxy<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> run, which is interesting not only because it marked the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.out.com\/books\/2021\/9\/28\/marvel-cancelled-guardians-comic-featuring-bisexual-star-lord\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">second cancellation of a series in which Star-Lord was queer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, but because the Guardians\u2019 handling in the comics has been heavily impacted by their portrayal in their movies. With this essay, Chan has exposed yet another display of disingenuity in regard to Marvel and DC\u2019s handling of marginalized characters. Their halfhearted approach to depicting queer characters suggests that their priority is to avoid upsetting intolerant audiences.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">While there is very limited visibility \u2014 Zo\u00eb Kravitz\u2019s Catwoman in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Batman<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> was <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2022\/film\/news\/zoe-kravitz-catwoman-bisexual-the-batman-1235192826\/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">played<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> as bisexual and Ryan Reynolds\u2019 Deadpool could be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/film\/2016\/feb\/11\/deadpool-the-pansexual-superhero-who-has-never-had-a-non-heterosexual-experience\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">interpreted<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> as pansexual \u2014 they still weren\u2019t seen as queer by the larger public.

It seems DC and Marvel don\u2019t want to risk disrupting the ubiquitously popular mainstream image of these characters to not deter their straight, cisgender male audience. Translations to the screen would be more likely if their queerness was more prominent in the source material.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/monica-rambeau-was-wandavisions-real-hero-and-the-show-1846433688?src=longreads\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Monica Rambeau Was\u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">WandaVision<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">&#8216;s Real Hero, and the Show Did Her Dirty<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (Charles Pulliam-Moore, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Gizmodo<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, March 2021)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Many heroes have taken up the mantle of Captain Marvel in the Marvel universe. In the 2019 film about the character, we were introduced to two of them: Carol Danvers, who became closely associated with the role since she took it on in 2012, and Monica Rambeau. If the movie was the extent of your exposure to either character, you might assume that Monica wouldn\u2019t follow in Carol\u2019s footsteps when it came to being a superhero. And you\u2019d have good reason not to, because Monica was actually Carol\u2019s predecessor. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ign.com\/articles\/monica-rambeau-marvel-wandavision-captain-avengers\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Introduced as the second Captain Marvel in the same year the original died<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, she quickly rose to prominence as an Avenger, even becoming the team leader during Roger Stern\u2019s tenure on the book. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/the-unfortunate-and-obscure-history-of-monica-rambeau-1726108988\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">However, she was sidelined soon after losing her powers and relinquishing her title to a newer character that was made to have stronger ties to the original Captain Marvel.\u00a0<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Since then, there have been various periods in the comics when Monica struggled to stay afloat appearance-wise. The past decade has seen a renewed effort to return her to the spotlight in titles like <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Ultimates, Damage Control<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, and her <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marvel.com\/articles\/comics\/photon-monica-rambeau-first-solo-comic-series-eve-l-ewing\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">upcoming solo series<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. Unfortunately, her appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far have failed to capture her might in more ways than one. In this piece, Pulliam-Moore delves into the issues with Monica\u2019s portrayal in her second MCU appearance, 2021\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">WandaVision<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. It\u2019s bad enough that Monica has been reduced to playing second fiddle as often as she has, but it\u2019s much more problematic that she\u2019s been portrayed in a way that suggests her heroic nature is heavily influenced by her white peers.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">While it\u2019s very nice to think that one would choose to be the bigger person after being possessed and attacked by a witch, this characterization for Monica given everything else that happens to her in the series felt like an unnecessary misstep that cast an unignorable shadow over the series as a whole. By not sticking its landing, all of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">WandaVision<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\u2019s subtle sleights against Monica lose their ability to work as dynamic texture to the story and more like a reminder of how the show missed a choice opportunity to point out how Black sitcoms were huge for a hot second before disappearing almost entirely from network television.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/movies\/movie-news\/why-spider-man-spider-verse-is-important-fans-color-1168367\/?src=longreads\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\u2018Into the Spider-Verse\u2019 and the Importance of a Biracial Spider-Man<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (Richard Newby, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Hollywood Reporter<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, December 2018)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marvel.com\/articles\/comics\/stan-lee-on-what-made-spider-man-so-special\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">When Stan Lee was asked why Spider-Man (Peter Parker) was one of his favorite characters<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, he responded that a key factor was Spider-Man\u2019s relatability. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who\u2019s most like me,\u201d he said in an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20220821174856\/https:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/news\/ct-xpm-1996-01-19-9601190195-story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">interview<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> with the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Chicago Tribune<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, \u201che\u2019s got a lot of problems, and he does things wrong and I can relate to that.\u201d This sentiment is likely one that resonated with fans: Spider-Man became one of Marvel\u2019s most popular characters shortly after his 1962 debut. Readers could see themselves in Peter Parker\u2019s everyday struggles when he wasn\u2019t wearing his mask. However, for legions of nonwhite readers, that relatability was only partial \u2014 at least until Miles Morales came along in 2011 to embody Lee\u2019s vision for the rest of the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">For a time, Miles lived in his predecessor\u2019s shadow. Fans knew that he was created in an offshoot universe that allowed creators to be more flexible with Marvel\u2019s iconic heroes. But he rose out of that shadow with the help of his unique powers and distinct background. Standing as his own hero when he was folded into the canonized main comics, Miles\u2019 existence embodies the importance of diverse representation in comic books. Like Captain America\u2019s debut long before him, Miles\u2019 success shows that for all the scrutiny a character may be subject to because of prejudice, there will always be an audience for characters whose identities are treated respectfully on the comic book scene.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Miles Morales\u2019 journey to becoming Spider-Man isn\u2019t a straight line. It\u2019s the strands of being black, Latino, a son, a nephew, an honors student, a graffiti artist, a hip-hop fan, all woven together to create the web that is the wide demographic of Spider-Man \u2014 a union of many of the best parts of humanity. There\u2019s a shot in the movie of Miles Morales starring up at a glass display case containing Spider-Man\u2019s uniform. It\u2019s a brief moment without dialogue, but it resonates as one of the film\u2019s most powerful moments because it represents Miles so well, and the tremendous legacy of carrying more than one identity. For all the kids of color who dream of being superheroes, and all the adults of color still grappling with power and responsibility,\u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">\u00a0leaves us with a clear message: We could always be Spider-Man with the mask on, but now, and perhaps more important, we can be Spider-Man with the mask off as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">* * *<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Joshua N.

It is ironic, perhaps, that the genre is often portrayed as outdated, irrelevant, even elitist \u2014 because folk music is, in fact, the antithesis of all these things. It is a living, revolutionary art form documenting the social concerns of humanity, created by the people, for the people.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But folk music can also be difficult to define. Carthy himself cites African-American blues guitarist Elizabeth Cotton as a major influence. Mongolian band <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehuofficial.com\/music\">The Hu<\/a> blends the sounds of horsehead fiddle with electric guitars and drums; in Japan, Wagakki Band incorporates the traditional three-stringed shamisen into its blend of heavy rock. This sort of recombinant cross-pollination isn\u2019t new: Since the widespread commercialization of sound recordings began in the early 1900s, arguments around \u201cauthenticity\u201d and the tension between tradition and innovation have raged across numerous cultures. Such debates reached an absurd height during Bob Dylan\u2019s infamous mid-\u201960s tour of the U.K., when an audience member, appalled at the singer\u2019s switch from acoustic to electric instruments, shouted that the musician was \u201cJudas!\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Martin Carthy himself, who has enjoyed a lengthy and successful career both as a solo artist and as a member of renowned groups Steeleye Span and The Albion Band, is no stranger to blending modern electric instruments with traditional acoustic equipment. Yet the concerns outlined above, as we can see from some of the articles presented below, continue to this day, alongside fears that traditional art forms may die out altogether: abandoned by subsequent generations in favor of newer, shinier sounds; falling foul of commodification; even, in extreme cases, deliberately smothered by political forces.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Which brings us back to the definition of folk music itself. What can we say for sure? \u201cIf\u00a0it was\u00a0never new, and it\u00a0never\u00a0gets\u00a0old,\u00a0then it\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0folk\u00a0song.\u201d So observes Oscar Isaac\u2019s titular musician in <i>Inside Llewyn Davis<\/i>, the Coen brothers\u2019 cinematic ode to the genre<i>.<\/i> I can think of no better way to describe this music, which continues to bring joy, pride, and hope to millions of listeners around the world.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/music\/2007\/jan\/21\/folk.features1?src=longreads\">Arctic Magic<\/a> (Chris Campion, <i>The Guardian<\/i>, January 2007)<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For some time, I have been fascinated by the yoik singing of the Sami people. Native to what is now Northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, the traditional\u00a0yoik\u00a0song form serves many purposes. It can be an identity marker for individuals living or dead, a tool of communication with animals and nature, even a doorway to other realms. It is an ancient tradition, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/22423982.2018.1454784\">with roots in prehistoric times<\/a>, but it is only relatively recently that this artform has seemingly been brought back from the edge of extinction.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"sidenote\">To further explore the depth and richness of Sami music, this list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.songlines.co.uk\/features\/essential-10\/the-10-essential-sami-albums\">10 essential albums<\/a>, as presented in <i>Songlines Magazine<\/i>, is a great place to start.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This article by Chris Campion provides a magical peek into the world of the yoik as it is experienced and practiced firsthand, chronicling the efforts of two young Sami determined to preserve and revive their beloved tradition. Happily, in the 15 years since the publication of this piece, yoik appears to have flourished, with several artists and bands recording commercially. Besides the group Adj\u00e1gas, who you will read about in this essay, albums by \u00c1ra, \u00c1\u0161\u0161u<i>,\u00a0<\/i>Marja Mortensson, Hild\u00e1 L\u00e4nsman, and Viivi Maria Saarenkyl\u00e4 have garnered significant acclaim.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\u201cSometimes in adjagas I feel that I understand all the world,\u201d says Sara. \u201cI understand all the questions that I sometimes wonder about. You feel that and then you are really open for these yoiks to come. If I couldn\u2019t yoik, I think I would die.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kosmosjournal.org\/kj_article\/desert-blues-the-music-goes-round-in-circles\/?src=longreads\">Desert Blues | The Music Moves in Circles<\/a> (Randall Grass, <i>Kosmos Journal<\/i>, Fall 2022)<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Blues music\u2019s standard 12-bar chord progression, which most experts agree developed from African American slave work songs and spirituals, underpins almost all Western popular music. What an absolute delight it is, then, to see the blues travel full circle, exported back to the country of its ancestry, reclaimed, repurposed, and revitalized. So-called \u201cdesert blues,\u201d emanating from Africa\u2019s Saharan region, has been steadily growing in popularity over the last 20 years, driven by the band Tinariwen, whose founding members first united while in exile in Algeria.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Tinariwen blends electric guitars with traditional instruments to create a beguiling blanket of sound that encapsulates the majesty and stark beauty of the Sahara, and their commercial success opened the door to a wave of like-minded musicians. The interaction between \u201cWestern\u201d blues and the African continent, however, goes back much further, as explored in this fascinating piece by Randall Grass, in which the author recounts his experiences with local musicians while living in Kano, Nigeria, during the mid-\u201970s.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Afterwards, I shared a beer with Alhaji Liu in a little bar. As we talked, via a translator due to my limited Hausa, an Albert King blues song played over the bar\u2019s sound-system. \u201cI can play that,\u201d Alhaji Liu said. That was my introduction to what has often been labeled \u201cdesert blues.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2020\/10\/05\/harry-smiths-musical-catalogue-of-human-experience?src=longreads\">Harry Smith\u2019s Musical Catalogue of Human Experience<\/a> (Amanda Petrusich, <i>The New Yorker<\/i>, September 2020)<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to name a record (or records) more influential than Harry Smith\u2019s <i>Anthology of American Folk Music<\/i>, which served as a virtual bible for \u201950s and \u201960s folk revivalists, Bob Dylan among them. Comprising recordings bought and selected by Harry Smith himself, this three-LP collection still stands as a cornerstone of Western popular music, and yet its genesis and rise to prominence form one of the strangest and most inscrutable tales in music history.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"sidenote\">You can read more about the anthology, and listen to its contents, at the official <a href=\"https:\/\/folkways.si.edu\/anthology-of-american-folk-music\/african-american-music-blues-old-time\/music\/album\/smithsonian\">Smithsonian Folkways online catalogue<\/a>.

A bohemian outlier with esoteric tastes, including a passion for magic and alchemy, he was only in his early twenties when he put together his \u201canthology.\u201d A practicing member of The Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica (a church founded by the infamous occultist and \u201cmagician\u201d Aleister Crowley), Smith held a predilection for the arcane, as evidenced by some of the wilder cuts included in this set. Bascom Lamar Lunsford\u2019s \u201cI Wish I Was a Mole in the Ground\u201d and Chubby Parker\u2019s \u201cKing Kong Kitchie Kitchie Ki-Me-O\u201d are both fine examples.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this fantastic essay, Amanda Petrusich explains exactly why this \u201cstrange cosmology of music\u201d continues to enjoy reverential status.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Once, in a strange fury of obsession, I spent several months on the lower level of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, trying to track down Smith\u2019s own 78s, some of which he had sold to the library before he died. Smith believed that objects have power; I thought there might be something to learn from holding those records in my hands.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/travel\/article\/20210414-a-revival-of-indigenous-throat-singing?src=longreads\">A Revival of Indigenous Throat Singing<\/a> (Joel Balsam and Stephanie Foden, <i>BBC<\/i>, April 2021)<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The particular strength of folk song is that it intrinsically belongs to its people. The music unites communities, entertains them, and documents their loves, losses, and struggles. It\u2019s a genre that has long been used to stir passions, swell pride, and resist injustice and oppression. Little wonder, then, that colonialists and dictators the world over have routinely sought to curtail, or even extinguish, the traditional music of the land. Folk music provides identity and hope, not least in the extraordinarily intimate tradition of Inuit throat singing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 20th century, Christian missionaries in the Arctic branded the music as blasphemous, even Satanic, in nature \u2014 and throat singing all but died out. This moving article by Joel Balsam and Stephanie Foden follows Shina Novalinga and her mother, Caroline, as they fight to reinvigorate the tradition via the distinctly modern means of social media.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In March 2020, when the first wave of the pandemic hit Montreal, Shina started sharing throat singing videos on TikTok. The videos also showcased the gorgeous <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@shinanova\/video\/6908890627497266433?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v2\">handmade parkas<\/a> sewn and designed by her mother along with facts about Indigenous history. \u201cFor me it\u2019s so normal, but I realised how unique it is for everyone to hear that, and even just different aspects of our culture, our food, our clothing,\u201d Shina said.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/features\/article\/9903-rhythm-in-your-blood-meet-the-young-artists-keeping-cubas-traditional-music-alive\/?src=longreads\">Rhythm in Your Blood: Meet the Young Artists Keeping Cuba\u2019s Traditional Music Alive<\/a> (Marisa Aveling, <i>Pitchfork<\/i>, June 2016)<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Cuba occupies a special place in music history. Partly thanks to its unique blend of Spanish, African, and Caribbean music, the island\u2019s creative influence extends across the globe, feeding numerous genres from jazz and rock to ballroom dance, classical, and even hip-hop. The spectacular success of the album <i>Buena Vista Social Club <\/i>and its accompanying documentary film, both of which showcased some of the best of the country\u2019s talent in the mid-\u201990s, brought Cuban music to a new generation \u2014 but much remains to explore.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"sidenote\">For more on the Buena Vista Social Club, including a full history, list of musicians involved and video clips, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buenavistasocialclub.com\/story\/\">the project\u2019s official website<\/a>.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically, Cuba\u2019s vibrant traditional music scene may well have thrived within its borders in part thanks to its relative isolation from the outside world. However, with the country appearing to gradually temper its hard-line stance, that relaxation may catalyze change. As Marisa Aveling observes in this fascinating piece, some are concerned that, new freedoms and visions \u2014 not to mention alien influences \u2014 may well distract young people away from their historic art forms. Enter the Manana music festival, the first such international event to take place on the island, and one aimed squarely at preserving and developing Cuban sounds.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an expression of Cuban style,\u201d says Geovani del Pino, the 73-year-old director of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCzj6fFPPdMMpL7hA8AIE2jg\">Yoruba Andabo<\/a>, the Latin Grammy-winning 15-piece band that has been fundamental in representing rumba internationally. \u201cI don\u2019t think that someone who calls themselves Cuban feels a conga without his feet moving.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/archive\/lifestyle\/1978\/05\/19\/griot-on-wheels\/36aba198-edcb-4ae9-a0ac-0549529d2fd8\/?src=longreads\">Griot on Wheels<\/a> (Joseph McLellan, <i>The Washington Post<\/i>, May 1978)<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Almost every civilization, it seems, has its version of the West African griots: itinerant musicians and orators, revered for both their skills and the vital role they play in preserving history and continuing traditions. Celtic cultures had ancient bards; Vikings had their skalds; classical Greece, its rhapsodes. Griots, however, still form an integral part of contemporary societies from Senegal and Mauritania to Nigeria and Mali, serving as living libraries, genealogists, entertainers, and ceremonial functionaries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this beautiful piece from 1978, Joseph McLellan talks to Batourou Sekou Kouyate, a griot from Bamko, Mali, as he tours America in an old station wagon, making new friends, new connections, and speaking with passion about the ancient craft of his art.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\u201cIn my country,\u201d he said in an interview at the Museum of African Art, \u201cI can go with my kora to anyone\u2019s house and say, \u201cI want you to help me,\u2019 and with three wives and 10 children, I could move into that house and spend my whole life there, and when I die my children could stay there after me.

In this craft-focused excerpt, we\u2019re digging into <a href=\"http:\/\/brendanomeara.com\/cassidy-randall-atavist-magazine-alone-at-the-edge-of-the-world\/\">Episode 336<\/a>, in which he interviewed <\/i>Atavist<i> editor Jonah Ogles and freelance writer Cassidy Randall about her work on the latest issue of <\/i>The Atavist<i>.<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Cassidy Randall, a freelance writer based out of Montana, sees herself more as a writer than a reporter, or a writer <i>first<\/i> then a reporter. There isn\u2019t any question she can report, as evidenced by her <i>Atavist Magazine <\/i>piece \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/magazine.atavist.com\/alone-at-the-edge-of-the-world-susie-goodall-sailing-golden-globe-race\/\">Alone at the Edge of the World<\/a>,\u201d but take a look at this opening sentence \u2014 read it aloud \u2014 and you will <i>hear<\/i> a writer at work:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><i>\u201cIn the heaving seas of the Southern Ocean, a small, red-hulled sailboat tossed and rolled, at the mercy of the tail end of a tempest.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The alliteration is beautifully embedded in this 25-word sentence.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cI love rhythm in sentences,\u201d Randall says. \u201cOne of the reasons I had chosen some of those longer sentences was that I wanted it to feel dreamlike, so that you have a long time to be in this moment.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Randall\u2019s story charts the story of Susie Goodall as she competed in the Golden Globe Race, a race to sail solo around the world. By this piece\u2019s very nature (Randall was not in the boat with Goodall), it\u2019s a masterclass in recreating scenes, something vital to this kind of storytelling.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cI like to spend a lot of time saying, \u2018Tell me what happens. Do you remember this?\u2019 And if there\u2019s a detail that I want to hear about that maybe gets a little glossed over, I always make time to go back. I\u2019m constantly writing these notes that say, \u2018Go back to this one thing. What was this? Be sure to follow up on this.\u2019 And so it\u2019s just a series of questions.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Randall also digs into how she deals \u2014 or doesn\u2019t deal \u2014 with rejection, as well as myriad other struggles common to the freelance-writer experience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Please enjoy this excerpt below, and listen to the <a href=\"http:\/\/brendanomeara.com\/cassidy-randall-atavist-magazine-alone-at-the-edge-of-the-world\/\">full episode<\/a> for more.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><i>These interviews have been edited for clarity and concision.<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>Brendan O\u2019Meara: If I had a harrowing boat-journey story, should I turn to you to edit it?<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>Jonah Ogles, <em>Atavist<\/em> articles editor: <\/b>The answer is, you should turn to Cassidy to write it. Man, she nailed this story, it was so much fun to work on. She had a really good handle on her character, and clearly knew what she was doing when it comes to adventure writing. Yes, the writing is good, but I\u2019m talking about pure narrative, the arc of the story itself \u2014 Susie Goodall\u2019s experience. When you get something like this, you just let it do its job. You tell the story, and you get out of the way, except for the parts where you absolutely need to be there.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>One of the more chilling aspects of the story is that you really feel like you\u2019re in the boat with Susie, and you feel the power and terror of this wave. When I spoke with Cassidy, she said that in an earlier draft there\u2019s \u2014 not a set piece, but several paragraphs explaining rogue waves, which sounds fascinating. But to your point, it might have been a little hiccup among what were already very good story blocks.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is a story where we cut things \u2014 not because they were bad, but because Susie\u2019s story on its own was so good. Rogue waves are a fascinating phenomenon, and especially when it comes into play in this story, because statistically speaking it shouldn\u2019t have occurred during this race.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Cassidy had all this really fascinating stuff about rogue waves and the scientific consensus about whether they\u2019re predictable in some way. The problem is, it happened during the storm, when Susie is out there on her own. As a reader, I\u2019m already there. I\u2019m invested. If you\u2019re watching a movie, it\u2019s like reaching the climax, and then stepping away for a second to have some narrator speak to you about the context of the scene. That\u2019s fine, but what we want to know is, <i>is the dude going to fire the gun or not?<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>The peril of nonfiction in so many ways.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I do this a lot: When I\u2019m cutting early in a piece I\u2019ll say, \u201cthere may be a place for this later in this particular story.\u201d We didn\u2019t end up reinserting it but there were other things that we did find a home for elsewhere. But in that moment, I just didn\u2019t.

What were some of the challenges that were unique to this piece as you were bringing it to life?<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This was less of an editing challenge than a challenge for Cassidy, although she really pulled it off: The majority of the words occur with Susie alone on a boat. It\u2019s like that Robert Redford movie <i>Alone<\/i>, where he\u2019s sailing alone on a boat, and there\u2019s virtually no dialogue. That\u2019s a difficult thing to do. How do you write thousands of miles of solo sailing, which includes periods of time in which nothing happens? How do you make readers feel close to this character when you don\u2019t really get to see her interact with anyone else? You have to be really deep inside Susie\u2019s head. Originally, Cassie had these snippets: Here\u2019s 200 words about marine wildlife she saw; here\u2019s 400 words about this piece of equipment malfunctioning. All of it has value and lets you know Susie in different ways, but as a reader it felt like getting postcards from somebody on a trip. \u201cHaving fun, had a good dinner.\u201d It was hard to feel like you were on the boat with her. So we tried to streamline.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another challenge was that her family becomes very concerned for her once she goes through the storm. After something like 12,000 words next to Susie, all of a sudden we need to be away from Susie to experience what\u2019s happening outside of her little bubble. So it was really a trial and error situation: Let\u2019s try dropping in with her family right <i>here<\/i>, and let\u2019s try 400 words. How does that feel? Not quite right. Let\u2019s move it, let\u2019s shorten it up, let\u2019s lengthen it. And we just did that until it felt like we\u2019d gotten it to a point where you\u2019re never away from Susie so long that you\u2019ve forgotten where you are in the narrative. But you\u2019re with the family long enough that there\u2019s some emotional resonance with them as well.

But part of it, too, is that Susie is just a really interesting character. She\u2019s not only doing this interesting thing, but she has an interesting perspective on it.

I also read <i>Voyage for Madmen<\/i> by Peter Nichols, which also chronicles the logs of those sailors in the original Golden Globe, and is a pretty propulsive read. If you\u2019re a sailor, he uses a lot of sailing terminology that ocean people absolutely love.

I\u2019m gonna read just the first sentence here, because I think this piggybacks on a lot of things that we were talking about already. \u201cIn the heaving seas of the Southern Ocean, a small red-hauled sailboat tossed and rolled at the mercy of the tail end of a tempest.\u201d It seems like there was a lot of attention put into the wordplay and construction of that sentence. What\u2019s your eye for detail when you\u2019re starting to construct sentences of that nature?<\/b><\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph \/-->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>I actually try to avoid outright alliteration. I love rhythm in sentences \u2014 I actually talked a lot with Jonah about this. As I was writing it, there were a lot more long-ish sentences throughout; in the top edit, Seyward cut a few of them up and made them shorter. I think she was right, but one of the reasons I had chosen some of those longer sentences was to give the piece a dreamlike feel. That\u2019s why that sentence starts out long, right? So that you have this long time to be in this moment.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph \/-->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><b>You said in working with Jonah and Seyward that you learned a thing or two about pacing.<\/b><\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph \/-->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>I told both of them that I wanted this to be a learning experience. I wanted to use this story-editing process with them to learn how to elevate my craft, and they both were very open to that. And they actually have the time to do that and are very willing to do that, which I\u2019ve thanked both of them for. But it\u2019s rare to find editors who have time to do that these days. So that\u2019s a huge, amazing experience if you want to learn as a freelance writer.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph \/-->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>I had written Susie\u2019s journey originally, when she set off, in a series of very short vignettes. I had done that because I wanted to convey that not much really happens when you\u2019re sailing, right? And when it does, it happens in bursts. But Jonah had this great point that you can\u2019t really expect your readers to trust you at that point. He said that readers typically take around 750 words \u2014 not all the time, but in general \u2014 to really drop into what the writer wants them to feel and what the writer wants to tell them. So that was huge for me to understand, in terms of pacing and passage construction.<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph \/-->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><b>As we bring this down for a landing, I always like asking writers to offer a recommendation of sorts to the listener.<\/b><\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph \/-->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Well, since we were talking about fiction, I want to recommend to anybody who loves reading joyous writing \u2014 have you ever read any Brian Doyle?<\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph \/-->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><b>Some of his essays.<\/b><\/p>\r\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph \/-->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>I just actually read <i>Martin Marten<\/i> twice.

Saying Goodbye to My Chest<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Naomi Gordon-Loebl | Esquire | October 10 | 3,875 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Tuesday was National Coming Out Day, making this a fitting week for Naomi Gordon-Loebl\u2019s essay about top surgery to make its debut. The piece operates in multiple registers, juxtaposing humor and gravity, hope and elegy, romance and pragmatism. The result is a brave, moving, and defiant piece of writing, one that quietly urges readers to set aside their assumptions about trans identity and much more. \u201cI never hated my chest. It\u2019s a perfectly fine chest; a good one, and I\u2019m fond of it, even,\u201d Gordon-Loebl writes. \u201cIt needs to go now, not because it is wrong, or something worth despising, but simply because it is standing in the way of a life I can no longer postpone.\u201d \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/seywarddarby\">SD<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"i-once-fell-for-the-fantasy-of-uploading-ourselves-it-s-a-destructive-vision\"><a href=\"https:\/\/href.li\/?https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/opinion\/story\/2022-10-10\/longtermism-climate-change-elon-musk?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">2. I Once Fell for the Fantasy of Uploading Ourselves. It\u2019s a Destructive Vision.<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Jean Guerrero | Los Angeles Times | October 10, 2022 | 1,764 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I was drawn to three reads this week, all of which touch on the promise or peril of technology in different ways: a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/href.li\/?https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/10\/07\/technology\/metaverse-facebook-horizon-worlds.html?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\">tour of Meta\u2019s VR social network<\/a>, a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/href.li\/?https:\/\/www.afar.com\/magazine\/space-perspective-the-company-making-space-travel-eco-friendly?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\">glimpse into a gentler alternative to space tourism<\/a>, and a piece that explores, and ultimately rejects, the fantasy of uploading ourselves to the metaverse. This third read, by Guerrero, introduces the beliefs of longtermism, a view that prioritizes the lives of faraway future generations over the Earth\u2019s existing ecosystems and the billions of people alive today. Guerrero had once fallen for the idea of digital immortality, which she recounts beautifully, but she now sees the techno-utopian visions of the Musks and Zuckerbergs of society as destructive and dangerous, rooted in eugenics, white supremacy, and capitalism. This is a short yet thought-provoking piece that has urged me to consider my own views in a fast-evolving world. \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cherilucas\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\" aria-expanded=\"false\">CLR<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"humans-are-overzealous-whale-morticians\"><a href=\"https:\/\/href.li\/?https:\/\/nautil.us\/humans-are-overzealous-whale-morticians-238529\/?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">3. Humans Are Overzealous Whale Morticians<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Ben Goldfarb | Nautilus | August 10, 2022 | 2,635 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s the best thing about a dead whale? This isn\u2019t the start of a bad joke, it\u2019s the primary question Ben Goldfarb poses in his fascinating piece at <em>Nautilus<\/em>. When whales have washed up in the past, we\u2019ve buried, incinerated, and even detonated them. \u201cIn 1970, the Oregon Highway Department infamously dynamited a gray whale, flattening an Oldsmobile beneath a chunk of flying blubber and leaving 75 bystanders flecked with putrescent meat.\u201d Gory mishaps aside, Goldfarb suggests that while it\u2019s not always practical, simply allowing a dead whale to decompose naturally allows legions of creatures to feed on the carcass and flourish. \u201cLately, some researchers have begun to pay closer heed to the value of stranded whales, and to encourage coastal managers to let carcasses lie. Granted, not every beach is an appropriate resting place for a reeking, 50,000-pound corpse. When circumstances allow, however, permitting dead whales to decompose in situ may be preferable to disposal.\u201d For more on how the Longbranch whale found a home in Eaton Hall at Seattle Pacific University, read Peter Wayne Moe&#8217;s \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/href.li\/?https:\/\/longreads.com\/2022\/02\/22\/bones-bones-how-to-articulate-a-whale\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">Bones, Bones: How to Articulate a Whale.<\/a>\u201d \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kristastevens\">KS<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"rod-mckuen-was-the-bestselling-poet-in-american-history-what-happened\"><a href=\"https:\/\/href.li\/?https:\/\/slate.com\/culture\/2022\/10\/rod-mckuen-best-selling-poet-songs-what-happened.html?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">4.

What Happened?<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Dan Kois | Slate | October 10, 2022 | 6,485 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A few months ago, I\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/href.li\/?https:\/\/longreads.com\/2022\/06\/24\/the-top-5-longreads-of-the-week-422\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">recommended a Dan Kois piece about OXO<\/a>, both because of the writing and reporting but also because it was just straight-up enjoyable. (And believe it or not, I got an angry email about that.)

Once upon a time, McKuen was one of the most famous and prolific creatives in the world. Sixty million books sold.\u00a0<em>One hundred million<\/em>\u00a0albums sold. He pumped out multiple volumes of text and sound each year, all of them utterly, irredeemably anodyne. What happened? Why doesn\u2019t his legacy endure beyond the bargain bin at used record stores? \u201cMcKuen\u2019s whole deal does not exactly fit into my sense of the tumultuous late \u201960s and early \u201970s,\u201d Kois readily admits.\u201d But, driven by curiosity \u2014 that most endangered of journalistic impulses \u2014 he dives into McKuen\u2019s life and catalog, and surfaces with both empathy and an arched eyebrow. Are you not entertained? \u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/provenself\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\" aria-expanded=\"false\">PR<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"the-haunting-of-a-dream-house\"><a href=\"https:\/\/href.li\/?https:\/\/www.thecut.com\/article\/the-haunting-of-657-boulevard-in-westfield-new-jersey.html?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">5. The Haunting of a Dream House<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Reeves Wiedeman | The Cut | November 12, 2018 | 9,365 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Netflix loves a true crime miniseries and yesterday released yet another one: <a href=\"https:\/\/href.li\/?https:\/\/www.vulture.com\/2022\/09\/the-watcher-netflix-trailer-cast.html#_ga=2.254238024.1190633466.1665678602-1693109676.1665532073\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\">The Watcher<\/a>. Yet to see it, I am hopeful it will be more nuanced than the endless parade of horrific murders dominating this genre. After all, the story it is based on is more spooky than gory. First detailed in 2018 by Reeves Wiedeman in his essay for\u00a0<em>The Cut,\u00a0<\/em>it is classic \u201cidyllic suburbia turns creepy,\u201d with the Broaddus family buying their dream home, only to begin receiving alarming letters to \u201cThe New Owner.\u201d With a strong horror vibe, these letters explain the writer has \u201cbeen put in charge of watching\u201d the house and asking questions about \u201cthe young blood\u201d living there. Wiedeman deftly builds up the suspense but also focuses on something more mundane: neighborhood politics. Fearing for their children, the Broadduses never move into the house, but this does not stop them from investigating their neighbors to find out who \u201cThe Watcher\u201d may be. Suspicions run high, with tensions overspilling in lawsuits and town council meetings. Managing to combine mystery with paperwork, Wiedeman creates a compelling story that you won\u2019t be able to stop reading. I hope Netflix does it justice. \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wells_ca?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CW<\/a><\/p>\n",

I am twelve years old, and I have an assignment due the following day for Earth Science. I have to make a working volcano. Most of the time there is no mustard, so I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to find the ingredients for a working volcano. Even now, years later, the bar for financial security is mustard. And paper towels. If I can afford both mustard and paper towels, I feel I\u2019m doing pretty damn well. But on the night in question, my father has said he can\u2019t afford the Plaster of Paris I need to make this working volcano, so I\u2019m looking for anything I can use instead.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I call it my father\u2019s kitchen. It\u2019s my father\u2019s apartment, really. I live there, I suppose, but it would be more accurate to say that I occupy the back bedroom of the place. I use the bathroom, and forage food from the kitchen cupboards and refrigerator; cereal and bread and government cheese and whatever else I can find, but mostly I keep to my room and my father keeps to his, lying on his bed listening to Frank Sinatra albums or watching Tarzan movies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nobel laureate Amartya Sen tells us that shame lies at the core of poverty. Anyone who grew up poor instinctively knows this to be true. She feels that shame every minute of every day, in the background if she is feeling good, in her face if she is not. The shame I already felt was about to get worse, and it would be ground into my bones forever.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote centre\">Nobel laureate Amartya Sen tells us that shame lies at the core of poverty.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It is early in my seventh-grade year. Until now I have been in class only with students from my side of town, the poor side. But it\u2019s a small town, so the rich kids and the poor kids are now funneled into one junior high school, and I find myself sitting next to classmates sporting all the markers of wealth: Straight teeth and sandy hair, Izod T-shirts and madras skirts and boat shoes. My father bought me two new school outfits, from Caldor. A pair of corduroys and a flowered peasant top (for the first day), jeans and a button-down collared shirt that makes me look like a security guard. I am desperate for a pair of boat shoes and have found some at the Salvation Army that are a size too small. I buy them anyway with three dollars I got somewhere, I don\u2019t remember where, and I jam my feet into them and wear them until a bony bump emerges on my heel. Eventually I can\u2019t take the pain anymore and give up wearing them. The bump is there to this day.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I find nothing in the kitchen, so I move to the bathroom, picking through the mounds of cotton balls and razors underneath the sink. My gaze descends the row of shelves in the bathroom closet, and finally, on the floor, settles on an unopened bag of kitty litter. This is the last place in the apartment. There\u2019s nowhere else to look. I take the bag, turn to the sink and remove the plastic top from an empty mouthwash bottle that\u2019s been sitting there for months. I gather cleaning supplies, go to my room, and get to work.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I stir the litter into a sluice held together with flour, water and glue until it resembles a melting ice cream sundae. I hollow out a cavity at the top, insert the mouthwash cap and smooth the slurry around it to hold it in place. When it comes time for the volcano to erupt, I will pour a mixture of the cleaning supplies into the mouthwash cap, they will react and overflow like lava. I\u2019ve tested it. It isn\u2019t what I\u2019d hoped to bring in, but it will work.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In class the next day I arrive before anybody else and set my volcano on the windowsill. Bits of kitty litter shake loose onto the tray and I quickly take my seat. My classmates file in and place their exquisitely constructed volcanos alongside it, painted, some snow-capped, with tiny trees dotting the landscape below, some even with miniature villagers who will be swallowed up in the impending eruptions. As they set down their volcanoes they cluster around mine and laugh, and I sit in my seat pretending to be engrossed in a book. The teacher arrives and class begins. One by one my classmates demonstrate their volcanoes, which spew and sputter and send lava flowing down their perfectly crafted slopes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When we are down to one volcano\u2014mine\u2014Mr. Brown calls on me to take my turn. I picture the volcano behind me, kitty litter pebbles skidding off its sides, and I feel my face bloom red and say I haven\u2019t done the assignment. There is only one volcano left, and all the other students have demonstrated theirs, so Mr. Brown knows I\u2019m lying and so do all my classmates, but Mr. Brown is a prince among men and pretends he doesn\u2019t. He pretends to scold me for not doing my work and says that just this once, because I\u2019m usually such a good student, he\u2019ll give me extra time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At home I tell my father what happened and give him a note from Mr. Brown. I don\u2019t know what it says but I think my father is embarrassed by it. He drives me to the store and buys me Plaster of Paris, and I work all weekend to finish my volcano, and demonstrate it the following Monday.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The shame of this episode is with me even now. It\u2019s like a piece of gut I\u2019ve coughed up into my throat, and it will be there until the day I die.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">***<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_148670\" style=\"width: 390px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-148670\" data-attachment-id=\"148393\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/longreads.com\/2021\/04\/06\/when-refugee-families-are-separated-women-carry-the-burden\/beyond-the-sand-and-sea-cover-image\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/longreadsblog.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/03\/beyond-the-sand-and-sea-cover-image.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1875,2850\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=\"Beyond the Sand and Sea Cover Image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/longreadsblog.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/03\/beyond-the-sand-and-sea-cover-image.jpg?w=197\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/longreadsblog.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/03\/beyond-the-sand-and-sea-cover-image.jpg?w=674\" class=\"wp-image-148393\" src=\"https:\/\/longreadsblog.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/10\/screen-shot-2022-10-06-at-12.57.10-pm.png?w=199\" alt=\"\" width=\"380\" height=\"578\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-148670\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a class=\"button-red\" href=\"https:\/\/www.indiebound.org\/book\/9781951724160\">Local Bookstores<\/a><br><a class=\"button-red\" href=\"https:\/\/bookshop.org\/books\/we-are-not-okay\/9781951724160\" style=\"margin-top: 10px\">Bookshop.org<\/a><\/p><\/div>\r\n\r\n<p>The more research scientists do on people who grew up in poverty, the more they realize that living in poverty is like being in a war. People who have grown up poor can have PTSD, and many don\u2019t have the mental bandwidth\u00a0that other people have for normal life stressors. Or at least I don\u2019t. I become frustrated very easily. If I can\u2019t get the lid off a jar, I feel like throwing the thing across the room. I once heard somebody say to an easily frustrated person, \u201cWho do you think you are? Everybody has to deal with these inconveniences. Why do you think you\u2019re so special that you don\u2019t have to?\u201d They have completely misunderstood, at least if it were me they were talking to. It\u2019s that I had already experienced so many normal life stressors by the time I was ten, I used up more than most people deal with in a lifetime. Ironically, that has also left me all out of fucks. I am frustrated and out of patience, so I am ready to dispatch with certain normal life stressors very quickly. I usually do this with the phrase \u2018Let me explain something to you,\u2019 and very calmly and deliberately explain to the person why they had better stop whatever they are doing. It\u2019s a strange amalgamation of emotions, and I don\u2019t always understand it myself.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Some things never leave you. You carry them forward to the third and fourth generation. Those things can be good, or they can be bad. When James Baldwin wrote the words in <i>Giovanni\u2019s Room<\/i> that begin this chapter, he was writing of social isolation, and one of the things he was grappling with was \u2018passing.\u2019 In <i>Giovanni\u2019s Room<\/i>, the scholar Valerie Rohy wrote, for Baldwin and millions of black and gay people, \u2018passing\u2019 had to do with racial and sexual identity. For me, passing means something different. It is a highly freighted term for a cis white person to use, I know, but I can think of no other way to describe it. For me, passing means trying to be anything other than what I was, and what I fear so desperately I always will be: poor white trash.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">***<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I am leaning against the wall in a game arcade watching another girl play pinball. A group of us are standing around her. The other girls have taken their turns and are waiting for the girl to use up her quarter so they can go again. The ball pings against the sides of the machine and bells trill and lights flash. I am desperate to play, but I don\u2019t have any money.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The girls are part of the drum corps I also belong to. We are at Hershey Park in Pennsylvania, on the tail end of a ten-day trip to perform at Disney World. I spent weeks selling candles and chocolate bars to raise money for the trip. That fund-raising covered the cost of gas for the bus and the other travel costs. But it didn\u2019t include any spending money. The other kids have received cash from their parents, enough to play arcade games and buy T-shirts and candy and souvenirs. Before I boarded the bus the morning we left, my father gave me $20. I spent it by the end of the third day. I do not belong here.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The girl\u2019s quarter shows no signs of giving out. She has kept the same ball in play for about five minutes, bouncing it off the sides, batting it away with the levers whenever it ricochets back. The director of the corps, Mr. Johns, comes up. He watches the game a minute, then looks at the other girls, their quarters ready, then at me. I lean against the wall, trying to look disinterested.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to play?\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have any money?\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cI had $20, but I spent it.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cYour father gave you $20 for ten days?\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I don\u2019t answer. I feel the heat rising on my face. I manage a shrug.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Johns takes out his wallet and finds a $100 bill and offers it to me. I thank him but decline.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says. \u201cTake it. I\u2019ll get it back from your father.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I know I shouldn\u2019t. I think of how angry my father will be that I told. How angry he\u2019ll be that he\u2019ll have to repay the $100. But I am nine years old and the pinball machine is ringing and the lights are flashing and I want to play. I take the $100 and thank Mr. Johns, and run to the change machine to get quarters.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I know I am lucky to have gone at all. But that\u2019s part of the shame. The other kids belonged there. I was lucky to have been included. I am a charity case.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>***<\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I don\u2019t know exactly when I gave up on America. I only know that it was long after America gave up on me. There are many stories of America, but this story is one we don\u2019t hear so often. It\u2019s the version of ourselves we don\u2019t like to think about, the one where poor people can\u2019t always pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where not every smart kid makes it out of the ghetto. The one where the American Dream is a lie. How do I tell it? How do I tell it so you will understand? Not for sympathy, just so you will understand what it has done to us, growing up poor.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>John C. Calhoun said, \u201cThe two great divisions of society are not the rich and poor, but white and black.\u201d With that pronouncement, he told one lie to hide another. He asserted one divide that does not naturally exist and denied one that does. There is no natural division between black and white or brown. Indeed, as James Baldwin and Toni Morrison and Ta-Nehisi Coates and others have pointed out, there is no black or white. The artificial division between black and white was invented by white people in the early days of America\u2019s formation through the court system, specifically, by wealthy white people. They needed a reason to justify their right to profit from the labor of others, so they invented labels. Black and white. There absolutely is a division between rich and poor, but the rich would prefer to pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. Otherwise, it would be clear that they have taken far more than their fair share and left the rest of us without.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>From the outside, I am the story we like to tell ourselves. At the age of 54, by any reasonable standard, I have \u2018gotten out.\u2019 I have a PhD, I\u2019ve lived in Europe for more than ten years, I was a journalist, I won awards. But on the inside, I am still the little girl in the projects eating government cheese. I dropped out of high school and still managed to get a PhD, but sometimes I don\u2019t remember how far I\u2019ve come. I\u2019m <i>up here<\/i>, but in my mind I\u2019m still <i>down there<\/i>. It\u2019s not only that there are external barriers, although there are; I still have severe money problems and have never managed to achieve financial security. The barrier is internal, and it affects nearly everything I do and every interaction I have. I suspect it is the same for many Americans.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote centre\">There absolutely is a division between rich and poor, but the rich would prefer to pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. Otherwise, it would be clear that they have taken far more than their fair share and left the rest of us without.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>People don\u2019t want to hear about poor whites for many reasons. One is that it threatens their ability to perpetuate the same old racist narrative that poverty is a \u2018black problem.\u2019 If black people are poor, goes the racist trope, it\u2019s because of something they did, so there is nothing society can do about it. If people acknowledge that there are also poor whites, they will have to acknowledge that it is not a \u2018black\u2019 problem. It is a problem with how we reward work, the kind of work we reward most generously, and how we conceive of society\u2019s responsibility <i>for<\/i> its poor and not just <i>to<\/i> them\u2014in other words, people are poor because society <i>makes<\/i> them that way and <i>keeps<\/i> them that way, because it is more important to most of America to pay millions of dollars to bankers than it is to pay a decent salary to teachers and sanitation workers and store clerks, and because they need to keep people poor enough to accept work they may not want to do. If people admitted all these things, then they might have to do something about it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The term <i>poor white trash<\/i> serves the same purpose\u2014to dismiss, to deny, to denigrate. If you\u2019re poor, it\u2019s because of something you did. If people acknowledge that there are poor whites, they must acknowledge that they themselves could also be poor at any moment\u2014if they think about it, perhaps they already <i>are<\/i>. This threatens the narrative of American exceptionalism, that anybody can get rich in America if they work hard enough. That is not true. It has never been true. But people fervently believe it; some so that they can view their own success as a sign of virtue and the result of their own hard work, others so that they can imagine their struggles as temporary, a bump in the road to their own eventual American Dream.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to the national narrative, we have always had class in America, and there have always been poor people. The nation was designed that way. As historian Nancy Isenberg, the author of <i>White Trash: The 400-year Untold History of Class in America<\/i>, has written, when the English were establishing colonies in Virginia and New England, they envisioned the poor as an expendable labor pool that would till the soil and husband the animals and build the colonies. They shipped them\u2014the working poor, ex-soldiers, beggars, and criminals\u2014to Jamestown, the Colony of Virginia and the Massachusetts Bay Colony and, in exchange for their passage, they would work to build the New World. They called them \u2018waste people.\u2019<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nobody wants to hear about poor whites, unless those whites are what people call rednecks and they voted for Donald Trump. I don\u2019t know any poor person who is a Republican. All the poor people I know are Democrats. And I mean yellow dog Democrats, an expression which means we would vote for <i>a ol\u2019 yella dog<\/i> before we would vote for a Republican. I can only ever recall meeting one poor person who voted for Donald Trump, and he had brain damage from an IED in Iraq. We vote Democrat, that is, when we vote, because we sometimes have trouble getting to polling stations, for lack of transportation, a lack of childcare, an inability to get the time off work, disabilities, and other problems.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote centre\">We vote Democrat, that is, when we vote, because we sometimes have trouble getting to polling stations, for lack of transportation, a lack of childcare, an inability to get the time off work, disabilities, and other problems.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We don\u2019t have the generational wealth of home ownership that allowed many working-class whites to move up to the middle class. It was also denied to black people because of redlining to keep black people out of \u2018white neighborhoods,\u2019 another way that black people and poor whites are in the same boat. Poor whites are kept out of those white neighborhoods, too, just in different ways; minimum credit scores we can\u2019t meet and down payments we can\u2019t save up or borrow from family. Another way we are not quite white. We are Catholics, Methodists, Baptists, agnostics, atheists. We are of English heritage and Irish, Italian and Portuguese, German and Polish and French and Greek and Hungarian and Scottish and Dutch.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I grew up in Groton, Connecticut. The way I grew up conflicts with the idea people have of Connecticut as nothing but big houses and leafy neighborhoods and clench-jawed bankers with Brahmin accents, the narrative you see in films, on television and in books. Unlike some working-class communities where factories that had formerly employed a whole town shut down and threw an entire community of working-class people into poverty, Groton had\u2014and still has\u2014two thriving major employers, Pfizer and Electric Boat, which employed a large part of the town and the surrounding towns besides, but no one in my family worked there. Hardly anyone in my family worked at all.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>My father blamed a teenage dive off a dock into shallow water for a neck injury and worked less and less until he stopped working altogether and went on welfare. He continued to cut hair in the kitchen and used the money to buy the first VCR as soon as it hit the market, as well as a stereo and every Frank Sinatra tape he could find. When he couldn\u2019t pay the rent anymore, he went on welfare and we moved to the projects. My mother had moved herself and my brother Adam there years before, along with my sister Jennifer, who she had after marrying my stepfather. My sister Charity would come along much later, from another man my mother lived with for several years.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The truth is, we couldn\u2019t stay where we were. We did not belong in a middle- or working-class neighborhood. It would not allow us to be who we were. So, we moved down, and down, and down again, until we settled in a place where our family\u2019s antics would be tolerated by our neighbors because they had no choice. No one had anyplace else to go.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>No matter how much we cleaned, the apartment was crawling with cockroaches. One night as I lay awake in bed, I looked up and saw one crawling on the ceiling directly above me. I launched myself out of the bed and slept on the couch that night. The next day I prowled my room with Raid, but I never found that cockroach.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the projects, every time I went outside, there was a need to be on guard. The scowl, arms at the ready, casual but alert, show that I was watchful, ready to go, that I couldn\u2019t be caught unawares, either by a girl who wanted to jump me or a boy who wouldn\u2019t accept no. Years before, when I was seven years old, an older boy of about twelve stole our kickball as friends and I played. I went to retrieve it, and he slammed it into my stomach so hard he knocked me to the ground. As I sat on the tar, catching my breath, I heard a voice above me.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cDid you hit my sister?\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I looked up. I don\u2019t know why he was there, he didn\u2019t even go to that school anymore, but there stood my brother. Adam\u2019s reputation preceded him, and the boy began stammering and apologizing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cOh, is that your sister? Sorry, man, I didn\u2019t know, I wouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But before he could finish the sentence, my brother punched him in the stomach. After that, he taught me to fight. The elbow is the hardest bone in the body. Use it. A hand to the nose will knock somebody out cold, but be careful or you might kill them. If they have hold of you from behind, a headbutt to their face will break their nose.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I also began to realize that I could use things in my environment, so when a school bully picked on my friend on the playground and began shoving her, I tapped him on the shoulder, and when he turned, I knee\u2019d him in the groin, spun him around, and slammed his face into a metal maypole. He later went to prison for rape.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But if you got caught out in the open, you had to front. A girl got in my face in the school parking lot one day out of the blue, throwing arms, her face up in mine. Her breath had that stale quality of someone who didn\u2019t brush her teeth regularly. A crowd gathered to watch. I didn\u2019t even know what I had done to her. Act casual. Eye the field, see what you can use. But we were in the wide open.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, my voice casual, my arms at my sides, but flexing, ready. \u201cWe can go if you want, but I don\u2019t want to hurt you. I don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re mad about.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>She fronted a little longer and I held my ground, my heart pounding, that click of dread in my throat. Then I guess she decided I might be able to take her.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right,\u201d she said, offering her hand. \u201cI thought you\u2019d chicken out, but you ain\u2019t no punk. You\u2019re a good kid.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I shook for an hour afterward.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You become hard. Don\u2019t smile. Don\u2019t show weakness. That is with me still. I never stroll. Part of me is always on watch, waiting for the unexpected launch, the assault, the confrontation, the male on the hunt. I catch myself doing it and relax my arms, then a little while later I notice I\u2019m clenching again, my shoulders tight. The need to do this is exhausting. The need to hide it even more so, to hide it from friends and colleagues who think I\u2019m another kind of person, that I\u2019m like them, that I\u2019m comfortable in my own skin.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote centre\">You become hard. Don\u2019t smile. Don\u2019t show weakness. That is with me still.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When I talk about poor people, I do not mean working class. It\u2019s important to stress that. There are many ways to explain the difference. It is in the shame a poor child feels in the cafeteria line for his free school lunch, in the face of a single mother as she tries to hide her food stamp card from the person behind her in the check-out line, in the worry of a man who has just finished another 12-hour shift and still doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll have enough to buy groceries for his children.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One way to explain it is in a conversation I had recently with a friend. He insisted that, until recently, America was guided, to its benefit, by middle-class values, that there was an understanding that education was important, knowledge was important, that you went to work, did your job, came home, kept your yard clean, respected your neighbors. Poor people do that, too, I said. My grandmother did that. It struck me, then, that we were talking about the same things; we were just using different terminology.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When my friend talks about the middle class, he mostly means the working class. Teachers make $30,000 to $50,000 a year. Teachers are middle class. Garbage collectors make $60,000, but nobody would call a garbage collector middle class. Garbage collectors are working class. My friend was talking about his grandparents. His grandfather was a groundskeeper; his grandmother worked in a ball bearing factory. He wanted to laureate their values, but saying that somebody is working class speaks of a lack of sophistication, so he spoke of middle-class values. The values were the same, but he had grown up absorbing the American idea that the middle class are better than the poor. Nobody ever talks about the values of poor people as though they\u2019re a good thing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Working-class people can, for the most part, keep their lights on. They can at least know that they will be able to buy groceries. They probably are not college educated, but they have steady jobs, jobs they may have had for years, jobs with benefits and a pension, however much they have shriveled in recent years. Or they have been laid off from one of those jobs but they have a skill, and that skill conveys pride. As well it should.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Poor people work two or three jobs, unskilled work that doesn\u2019t require a trade. Or they don\u2019t have the wherewithal to hold down a job and are on welfare. Their parents were poor and their labor wasn\u2019t valued, or they were mentally ill or addicts, and their children imbibed that hopelessness. Maybe they have dropped out of high school. Maybe they have bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Maybe they have an addiction. Mental illness, substance abuse and poverty can go hand in hand, as they did in my family. Which begets which? It\u2019s not always that simple. It is not correct to say that drug use causes mental illness or that all those who are mentally ill are poor by choice; the same is true for those who are disabled. Indeed, in my experience, substance abuse is often done for self-medication. My mother did it, my brother did it, many people in my family did it, because they had undiagnosed mental illnesses and were ignored by the system because they were poor. My mother\u2019s bipolar disorder went undiagnosed for years, so she lived with the misery of the depression and the crazed ideas fomented by the mania, and we, her children, lived with the outcomes. That is not my mother\u2019s fault. It is the fault of the people who saw her behavior and its results as her own fault, a perception colored by the fact that she was poor, and didn\u2019t look past that to recognize that she had a mental illness. Other people are just ignored because they\u2019re poor. Waste people.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote centre\">Mental illness, substance abuse and poverty can go hand in hand, as they did in my family. Which begets which? It\u2019s not always that simple.<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>People may pick up the drug or the bottle, and certainly we are all responsible for our own choices, but what has America offered them instead? The idea that we are waste people is older than the country, and that knowledge that you are not valued by society wears you thin. In the housing project where I grew up, we were a bike ride away from the beach. But nobody I knew from the projects went there. Working class people did. But they had cars. There was no public transportation where I grew up. No bus to the beach from the projects. Or to any place of work, significantly. You needed a car or a bicycle. Most people in the projects didn\u2019t have a car, except the drug dealers, and they slept during the day. Hardly anyone had a bike. Maybe they had enough money to give their kids a dollar for the ice cream van, but not enough for a bike, not for their kids and certainly not for themselves. And even if they did, they couldn\u2019t conceive of the energy it would take, biking to the beach. It\u2019s easier to sit on the porch, fan yourself in the heat and take comfort from an ice cream bar. This is the despair of poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I have never owned a home, and I probably never will. Part of the reason for that is that I have never made enough money to make home ownership an attainable\u2014or practical\u2014goal. There was no down-payment loan available from a parent and I couldn\u2019t save the money on my own. I could barely pay my bills. Once, when I was living in New York City, a friend called asking if I wanted to split a summer house in the Hamptons. My share would be $2,000. I desperately wanted to go, to get out of the city, to feel the sea air and hear the marsh grass flutter in the breeze and make smoothies and drink them on the deck, to spend time with my friend, but I didn\u2019t have the money. Friends went on expensive holidays, ate at upscale restaurants, lived in apartments in Manhattan; I lived in a studio apartment in a condemned building. I had a degree from a prestigious university. I had a professional job. But I have never been successful at saving money.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That is also a consequence of growing up in poverty: the need for immediate gratification. If I get money, I spend it immediately, as though somebody might take it away from me. Because my whole childhood, people did. When I was nine years old, I had saved about $400 from working in my grandmother\u2019s lunch shop. Syl\u2019s Food Shop, it was called. It had been serving breakfast and lunch to the workers at Electric Boat for years when my grandmother and aunt bought it from Syl, and they kept the name because the Electric Boat workers knew it. My mother convinced me to open a joint bank account. She would keep the money safe, she said. My father warned me not to do it, but I was drawn by the lure of the bank account as a connection to my mother. So I did it. When I went to withdraw $20 a month later, the account had been cleaned out. When I was twelve, I had saved up more money from working in my grandmother\u2019s shop. This time I was smart. I came home every afternoon and hid the bills in my books. A few dollars in each book. One day when I came home, the books were spilled out all over the floor, splayed open, all the money gone. My brother had found it. When I was in my early twenties, I bought a plane ticket to Italy and was waiting for a check to arrive to use as spending money. They sent it to my mother\u2019s house, and she convinced a bank teller to cash it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, when I get money, I spend it quickly. Psychologists tell us that people who grew up in poverty have trouble controlling impulses, especially the impulse to buy. Being poor can have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apa.org\/topics\/willpower-poverty-financial.pdf\">permanent detrimental effect on your decision-making<\/a>. If I had left the house with a dollar in my pocket, I would have spent it by the time I got home. This decision-making continued into adulthood. I once paid $600 for a set of Calphalon cookware when I was about to take custody of my baby sister, even though I only made $23,000 a year. My reasoning was that I had to have enough pots and pans to make a complete Thanksgiving dinner at all times. It\u2019s something I\u2019m working on, and I\u2019m much better than I used to be, but not too long ago I bought a skirt on credit for \u00a3175 because I thought I would look cool in it at readings.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A few years ago, a friend of mine, in a well-meaning attempt to understand the impoverished diets of poor people, ate a Food Stamp diet for a week. On the last day of the diet, he talked about what he had learned and spoke philosophically about his renewed appreciation of healthy food as he prepared to end his restricted diet with his first good meal of the week: homemade vegetable pizza. He thought about what he had learned as he kneaded the pizza dough. He had already sliced the vegetables, and they sat piled high on the cutting board. While he had the best of intentions, what he said made me sad. He had misunderstood.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In his week of eating like poor people, he had missed two crucial ingredients: fear and shame. While he was looking forward to breaking his fast that night, poor people don\u2019t get to do that. They don\u2019t get to look forward to the end of impoverishment, to a good meal. My friend would eat a healthy meal that night, and he had known throughout the week that he could stop whenever he wanted, that all he had to do if he missed healthy food was open his refrigerator. Poor people never know when their next good meal will come. They look in the refrigerator on the 25th and maybe they only have enough food for a couple more meals but they don\u2019t get paid for a week. And vegetables are expensive. Most poor people can\u2019t afford them. All of this causes great shame. Shame that they don\u2019t make enough money, shame that they can\u2019t give their kids decent food, shame that they must rely on government assistance, shame that they can\u2019t afford the restaurant their friends want to go to on Saturday night. That shame never goes away. It is not my friend\u2019s fault that he does not know this. He doesn\u2019t know it because society does not talk about such things, does not want them talked about. The result is that my friend would never understand how poor people feel\u2014never understand me\u2014and I felt sad and alone.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>How do I tell it? How do I tell it so you will understand? Not for sympathy, just so you will understand what it has done to us, growing up poor. Because you have to understand. We are not okay.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>We Are Not Okay<\/em> was published on October 1st, 2022 by <a href=\"https:\/\/indieblu.net\/\">Indie Blu(e) Publishing<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span lang=\"EN-US\">Christian\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\">is also the author of a fiction chapbook,\u00a0<\/span><\/em><span lang=\"EN-US\">Girl, <\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Lost and Found <\/span><em><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Alien Buddha Press, 2021), and her stories and essays have appeared in anthologies and literary journals including\u00a0<\/span><\/em><span lang=\"EN-US\">Santa Fe Writers Project<\/span><em><span lang=\"EN-US\">,\u00a0<\/span><\/em><span lang=\"EN-US\">Salt Hill Journal<\/span><em><span lang=\"EN-US\">,\u00a0<\/span><\/em><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Texas Review<\/span><em><span lang=\"EN-US\">, <\/span><\/em><span lang=\"EN-US\">Meat for Tea<\/span><em><span lang=\"EN-US\">, and <\/span><\/em><span lang=\"EN-US\">Witch-Pricker<\/span><em><span lang=\"EN-US\">.\u00a0She has a PhD in Creative Writing from the University of St Andrews in Scotland with an academic focus on medieval English literature and has taught creative writing at Newcastle University and medieval literature at the University of St Andrews.\u00a0She worked for ten years as a journalist.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p>\u00a0<\/p> <\/div>",

Dead Man Living<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Elizabeth Bruenig | The Atlantic | October 2, 2022 | 4,221 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When it comes to ensuring humane treatment of those set to die by lethal injection, the Alabama Department of Corrections would like you to keep your seat and remain quiet. The signs in the witness room of the Holman Correctional Facility execution chamber say as much. Elizabeth Bruenig, a staff reporter at <em>The Atlantic<\/em>, has found that department officials are as impervious to important questions about the safety and dignity of the lethal injection process as the witness room&#8217;s cinderblock walls. This is a hard but necessary read about the lack of communication and transparency in Alabama\u2019s capital punishment process and the egregious and completely unnecessary harms the state can cause to those condemned and the loved ones who endure the needless suffering of delayed or botched executions. \u201cRobert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, an educational nonprofit organization, told me that Alabama\u2019s latest failure to carry out an uncomplicated execution represented an endemic problem. \u2018This is the third execution in the last five years that Alabama has botched by virtue of their own incompetence in setting IV lines,\u2019 offering Joe Nathan James and Doyle Hamm, who survived a 2018 lethal injection attempt in the state, as the two prior examples. \u2018Each time, ADOC has denied the obvious and claimed nothing went wrong. They say they\u2019ve followed their protocol. One of these things must be true: Either they\u2019re unreliable, or their protocol is unreliable. Neither one is acceptable when a person\u2019s life is on the line.&#8217;\u201d \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kristastevens\">KS<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"mike-conner-vs-the-pain\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.esquire.com\/lifestyle\/a41502433\/mike-conner-pain-survival-essay\/?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">2. Mike Conner v. The Pain<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Joshua St.Clair | Esquire | October 5, 2022 | 4,377 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Esquire<\/em>, the magazine that first made me fall in love with longform journalism, is at its platonic best when it gets inside someone\u2019s head. I don\u2019t mean the reader\u2019s head, though that\u2019s often a result; I mean it gets inside the head of the people at the heart of its features. And here, that person is Mike Connor, who nine years ago fell five stories onto concrete, feet first. This is the story of his survival. Of his refusal to accept his shattered bones and pulverized body as a forever state. There\u2019s little dialog here, because while Mike Connor has children and a family, his journey started within. It\u2019s sparely written, though it finds beauty in that austerity. It doesn\u2019t linger on descriptions of the outside world. Instead, it sits patiently ringside to the fight of Mike Connor\u2019s life: his battle with an agony so ever-present that, as St. Clair writes, it\u2019s like \u201can emotion \u2026 like rage, like afternoon sadness.\u201d I can\u2019t lie: it\u2019s been a while since I read something like this in <em>Esquire<\/em>. But it feels like coming home. \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/provenself\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PR<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"departures-by-tan-tuck-ming\"><a href=\"https:\/\/kenyonreview.org\/journal\/sept-oct-2022\/selections\/departures\/?src=longreads?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">3. Departures<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Tan Tuck Ming | Kenyon Review | October 3, 2022 | 5,407 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In this essay, Tan Tuck Ming reflects on what\u2019s gained and what\u2019s lost for the hundreds of thousands of Filipina workers who come to cities like Hong Kong for work as domestic helpers, leaving their loved ones and entire lives at home to become embedded in new families abroad. Tang writes from the perspective of an employee who conducts intake interviews with workers seeking new jobs, but also as someone who grew up in a household with maids. (His Auntie Mel is the maid he remembers the most, and the woman he associates with love.) Tang tells the heartbreaking story of one woman, Daisy, who\u2019s given up so much. \u201cWhat is the Filipina brand of love?\u201d asks Tang. \u201cIt is to love your family to the degree that to provide for it you would become contracted to another. It is to love a child by leaving and loving other children with the same hardness, because while the intensity of love is undeniable, the value of its currency is what flickers and grows across a border.\u201d Sadly, this is the story for so many. \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cherilucas\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CLR<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"a-convo-with-svetlana-alexievich\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lareviewofbooks.org\/article\/the-storykeeper-a-conversation-with-svetlana-alexievich\/?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">4. The Storykeeper: A Conversation with Svetlana Alexievich<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Jos\u00e9 Vergara | Los Angeles Review of Books | September 27, 2022 | 4,420 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I was 15 when disaster struck the Chernobyl Nuclear Power plant in 1986. Over 35 years later, I still struggle to comprehend the accident\u2019s human and environmental toll. For the original edition of <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiebound.org\/book\/9781628973303\">Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster<\/a><\/em> Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich interviewed countless survivors to give voice to those affected, attempting to create \u201ca kind of temple made of human lives and human voices.\u201d In this deeply personal interview at the <em>Los Angeles Review of Books<\/em>, Alexievich talks about the revised edition of her book, an account made deeper by subjects who \u201cfound new memories, new bravery,\u201d and added to their original stories, feeling less vulnerable about revealing their full experiences in a post-Soviet era. \u201cPeople start talking in the style of what they read. I try to get at what is real and understand what people experienced and really felt in the moment. The most amazing thing was when somebody told me, &#8216;I didn\u2019t even know what I knew and felt before [our conversation].&#8217; We process the experience together, the interviewee and myself. We think about the world together.\u201d \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kristastevens\">KS<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"human-composting\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/c\/23307867\/human-composting-process-return-home?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\">5. Inside One Of The World\u2019s First Human Composting Facilities<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Eleanor Cummins | The Verge | October 3, 2022 | 2,457 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We all die, though when someone you love passes and you\u2019re mired in grief, reducing the environmental impact of your loved one\u2019s body isn\u2019t generally top of mind. Burial and cremation are standard options, but both pollute the environment. Embalming fluids can leach through a casket and contaminate the soil. Cremation requires a lot of fuel and releases carbon dioxide into the air. But, what if we could actually give back to the earth after we die to help trees, plants, and flowers to flourish? Enter natural organic reduction (NOR), or human composting, which is now legal in four states and counting. In this insightful piece at <em>The Verge<\/em>, Eleanor Cummins reports on how NOR started off as an idea in Katrina Spade\u2019s 2013 graduate thesis and has since become a cost effective and environmentally friendly way for families to say goodbye to their loved ones. \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kristastevens\">KS<\/a><\/p>\n",

          "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">At the start of 2020, my daughter Emilia turned 18 months. This was an age that promised a series of new beginnings, including enrolling her in preschool and, in turn, gaining a few hours of child-free time. As we approached spring, I was even feeling ready to introduce her to new social settings beyond the playground. Being the raver at heart that I am, this meant taking her to all the daytime outdoor house and techno parties I used to attend. I couldn&#8217;t wait to strap her onto me in an Ergobaby carrier so I could dance freely \u2014 and reenter a world that I loved and missed so much. But when lockdown became our reality, none of this happened. This past weekend, then, was a long time coming: I took Emilia, now 4, to her first event, complete with DJs, ravers, Burners, and thumping house music.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">As my nights out dancing until four in the morning became less frequent in my 30s, I gained a few things \u2014 sleep, brain cells \u2014 but lost a cathartic and deeply physical outlet to music. Taiko, which I practiced for a few years before I became pregnant, unexpectedly became a way for me to reconnect to both music and a community. I drummed and performed a lot during those nine months, my round belly absorbing the rumbles of big Japanese drums, so the music\u2019s deep vibrations at the party shouldn&#8217;t have been a totally unfamiliar sensation to her. Still, loud and frenetic dance music can be <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">a lot<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> for a preschooler, even one who grew up with mama&#8217;s Soundcloud mixes playing at home. In fact, while we were out among the crowd, surrounded by dancing strangers, she felt safer being held \u2014 so I kept her close, our chests glued together, our bodies experiencing the four-on-the-floor beat as one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There were moments that afternoon, as she embraced me tightly while I danced, when I couldn&#8217;t help but feel like I&#8217;d <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">returned<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. But to what? It&#8217;s always been a challenge to articulate how freeing and empowering it is to move to this music \u2014 to house and techno and breaks and drum &amp; bass and jungle \u2014 which is why I lean on other people&#8217;s words. The pieces below immerse us in distinct experiences, whether the wild life of a superstar DJ on Ibiza or the darkness of a famed Berlin club, but what they all do well is encapsulate the pull of the rave for me, after all these years. <\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2022\/10\/03\/solomun-the-dj-who-keeps-ibiza-dancing?src=longreads\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Solomun, the D.J. Who Keeps Ibiza Dancing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (Ed Caesar, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The New Yorker<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, September 2022)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Ed Caesar&#8217;s piece on Solomun, a DJ described by some people as the &#8220;king of Ibiza,&#8221; prompted me to compile this list. It\u2019s an entertaining profile of a DJ living a glamorous life, but what really got me were the lines that capture the timelessness of a long and transformative DJ set. (Solomun, known for his marathon sets, once played for 27 hours straight at Club Space in Miami.)<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">When Solomun began his set, I was transfixed. This was no sugar rush. I didn\u2019t know any of the music, I didn\u2019t even understand some of it, and there were stretches when I didn\u2019t take much pleasure in what I was hearing. The music was presented as one long phrase, continually promising a resolution that never materialized\u2014it was like being trapped inside a five-hour Bach fugue. &#8230; We remained on the dance floor until 7 a.m. I emerged onto the sidewalk, astonished by the morning sunshine and tottering like a newborn foal\u2014a convert.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Caesar got into dance music later in adulthood, calling it &#8220;a strange kind of midlife awakening&#8221; and &#8220;a bug&#8221; that his wife caught as well, so there&#8217;s a bit of a fledgling perspective he brings to the piece. Still, I love Caesar&#8217;s observations about a Solomun set: a spontaneous, crowd-inspired, moment-to-moment manifestation of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">now, <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">which he describes beautifully in these lines:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But a set cannot be designed as a future relic. It is a work of improvisation that succeeds or fails as it flows onto the dance floor. Solomun says that his job is to \u201ccreate moments.\u201d The evanescence is the thing.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/strangersguide.com\/articles\/queer-psychedelic-new-orleans\/?src=longreads\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Acid Church<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (Courtney Desiree Morris, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Stranger&#8217;s Guide<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, May 2022)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">After reading the Solomun profile, I revisited Courtney Desiree Morris&#8217; moving essay from earlier this year about her grandmother, her love for New Orleans, and finding her queer tribe. I love the raw and bold writing, the palpable energy during the fuzzy wait for a drug to hit, the urgent and primal need to dance. &#8220;I am enveloped in a crush of vibrating flesh,&#8221; Morris writes, which may not sound appealing, but it reminds me of what it used to be like to get pleasantly lost on a packed dance floor, dancers\u2019 slick arms grazing mine as I found my way into the hive&#8217;s warm core. For Morris, the dance floor also brings joy, and a sacred space to both surrender and remake oneself.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I return to the dance floor and dance for the DJ for what feels like hours. I roll my hips like the Mississippi, joints loose and easy, feeling light and free. I cannot remember the last time I felt this way. That makes me sad. I accept this insight and let it go as quickly as it comes. I am here in my body right now, and I am dancing like a bad bitch. The beat drops into a smooth bassline as I sweat the grief out. I dance for my grandmother. I dance for the elders in the synagogue. I dance for Ntozake. I dance for all the Black women I know dying from cancer and strokes and stress and sadness. I dance and dance and dance and laugh and celebrate and feel my aliveness.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/astra-mag.com\/articles\/notes-from-the-underground\/?src=longreads\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Notes From the Underground<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (Zack Graham, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Astra<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, April 2022)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This essay by Zack Graham, which I recommended <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/longreads.com\/2022\/04\/15\/the-top-5-longreads-of-the-week-413\/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">back in April<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, recounts his first experience at an underground rave in a warehouse in Queens, and his later encounters with underground scenes abroad, notably Vienna&#8217;s Freetekno movement in which people take &#8220;the origins of raving to an extreme.&#8221; Like Caesar, Graham observes and revels in the timelessness of his experience. But, like Morris, he&#8217;s also aware of the power of the body, and the escape this world provides.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">My body moved in ways I\u2019d never thought possible. The track unleashed a creature inside me and time disappeared. Night had already fallen when I managed to extricate myself from the warehouse. I was shocked to discover I\u2019d been there for eleven hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The more times I went to the party, the more quickly and seamlessly I transitioned into that timeless flow-state. I started wearing scarfs and shawls and cloaks and weird sunglasses. I hooted and purred and hollered when the DJ transitioned. When I went underground, my life above ground became a distant memory. I entered a parallel reality. When I walked through that door, I became someone else. There was no grand design, nothing to be gained, no goal to be accomplished, no honor to achieve. I simply was.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronicbeats.net\/electronic-music-is-black-protest-music\/?src=longreads\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Electronic Music Is Black Protest Music<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (Whitney Wei, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Electronic Beats<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, June 2020)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">In this piece, written in the weeks after George Floyd&#8217;s murder, Whitney Wei traces the history of techno&#8217;s origins. She explains how Black DJs \u2014 pioneers like Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson \u2014 created the sound in the early \u201980s in response to the decay and decline of post-industrial Detroit.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Nightclubs, as it so happens, bear a long legacy of being one of the very few spaces in society where Black and Brown people are able to freely express themselves, where they are able to, for a few short hours, reclaim the bodies that are systematically regulated, attenuated, and deliberately destroyed by the state.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Wei describes the spread of techno and house to Europe, including Germany and the U.K., commenting that &#8220;its European regional variants quickly became divorced from the genre\u2019s original ethos of sublimating Black and Brown collective trauma into art.&#8221; It&#8217;s important to realize that rave and club culture \u2014 and their vision of the dance floor as a haven \u2014 is rooted in the struggle and survival of Black and brown people.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Through this assessment, freeform dancing, the process of trusting an innate, rhythmic impulse that shirks a set of codified behaviors, then becomes a powerful gesture of resistance. It\u2019s no coincidence that rave music and its surrounding culture of escapism originated in Black and Brown communities. These underground club scenes have traditionally provided a momentary refuge for sexual and ethnic minorities from persecution, but, even more powerfully, they have provided a space to cultivate the self-sustaining joy and pride that is so often stripped from them.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thewhitereview.org\/feature\/really-techno\/?src=longreads\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Really Techno<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> (Julia Bell, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The White Review<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, June 2018)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Julia Bell&#8217;s entrancing account of Berghain is one of my favorite reads of the past several years on dancing and the rave scene. In the darkness of Berlin&#8217;s famous nightclub known for both its techno and its strict door policy, Bell notes a less overtly joyful atmosphere than what Morris describes. In Berghain, ravers\u2019 movements are more militarized and precise than elsewhere \u2014 their bodies twisting and angling as physical manifestations of the beat. Like a Solomun DJ set, nothing is planned, and yet everyone moves exactly as they should in a symbiotic display. Even though dancers here are focused on their own journeys, the dance floor is still communal \u2014 it ebbs and flows as one organism.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Dancing to techno rejects the disco values of sociability, of looking at your partners, making eye contact, for a much more individuated approach. Everyone on the dance floor is together but separate, facing the DJ booth, lost in sound and light. You dance with other people as anonymous silhouettes, maybe catching someone\u2019s eye when the break is especially ecstatic or a mix just dropped. Watching from the edges, the dance floor heaves, it moves as one body, like the surface of the sea.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I especially love Bell&#8217;s observations about her body&#8217;s automatic movements. She describes dancing not as her body&#8217;s response to sound \u2014 her body <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">becomes<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> the sound.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I let myself into the rhythm and my limbs move of their own accord. I don\u2019t control it. I\u2019m not making any rehearsed moves, just letting my nervous system respond to the beat. My arms and legs and torso move as if connected to the sound, bypassing consciousness.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Like the writers above, Bell works toward a moment of clarity; she knows that the dance floor, this shared experience, connects her to something larger. Reading how they all come to this realization is a powerful thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">I am not aware of myself. I am at once all body and no body. I am out of time, out of language, my mind all sensation. \u2026 In this place I am connected to something bigger than me, a place outside the ego. The split parts of me are, for these few moments, suddenly whole.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n",

          "content": "<p>If I visit a restaurant alone, I always bring a book. When I&#8217;m on a plane, the first thing I do is put my earbuds in, but more often than not, nothing is running through them. Why the book? Why the silent earbuds? I use both as prophylactic to interactions with other people. And in this case, it&#8217;s definitely not you; it&#8217;s me. I find small talk difficult, almost painful. I&#8217;d rather be silent than make idle chatter. But I read something this week that sparked a memory and reminded me that I am doing it wrong, and that I need to do better. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thejosevergara\">Jos\u00e9 Vergara<\/a> has an <a href=\"https:\/\/lareviewofbooks.org\/article\/the-storykeeper-a-conversation-with-svetlana-alexievich\/\">insightful interview with Svetlana Alexievich<\/a>, author of <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiebound.org\/book\/9781628973303\">Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster<\/a><\/em>, up at the <em>Los Angeles Review of Books<\/em>. Alexievich talks of interviewing disaster survivors, of her desire to connect deeply with the people she&#8217;s speaking with. <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Sometimes I\u2019m deeply interested in talking to an old woman in a village, who hasn\u2019t read Tolstoy or Dostoevsky, but who speaks so interestingly. She sees the nature of things that are completely unclear to me. I cannot understand it, and I never thought about it. She did. I sometimes talk to children who are very unusual. They have a different outlook. That depends on something else: how well we live; how talented we are and how experienced in our way of thinking; how seriously we penetrate life; how far we leave banality behind, because most people live and eat banality, and that\u2019s enough. But the thing is, to create your own creature out of yourself, without the perspective of everyone else\u2019s life, to contribute things that have not been said in books, even in good books, to change your outlook, to offer a text that has not been experienced in the human archive \u2014 that is a great work, and you must work on it your whole life.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Alexievich is so right. Conversations with strangers can be deeply rewarding, if only I make myself open to them. <\/p>\n<p>I traveled to New York City once. I can&#8217;t remember precisely what year it was or why I was going to New York. What I do remember? My airplane seat mate. I had my book closed on my lap, on the ready, but he was quick. He started to ask me questions. I began thinking about how to open my book at a natural pause. (I didn&#8217;t want to be rude.) He had a Long Island accent. He worked for some &#8220;byore-oh&#8221; (bureau) of the U.S. government and I discovered he took this same flight every week, returning home from a consulting job. He was genuine and friendly. Our conversation lasted from wheels up to wheels down at La Guardia. I can&#8217;t even remember what it was that we spoke about, just that to my surprise, I truly <em>enjoyed<\/em> talking with him. The two-hour flight literally flew by. We were just a couple of humans, overcoming the banality of existence to make a memorable connection with a total stranger. <\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button-red\" href=\"https:\/\/lareviewofbooks.org\/article\/the-storykeeper-a-conversation-with-svetlana-alexievich\/\">Read the interview<\/a>  <\/p>\n",

The boat\u2019s mast was sheared away, its yellow sails sunk deep in the sea. Amid the wreckage of the cabin, Susie Goodall sloshed through water seeping in from the deck, which had cracked when a great wave somersaulted the boat end over end. She was freezing, having been lashed by ocean, rain, and wind. Her hands were raw and bloody. Except for the boat, her companion and home for the 15,000 miles she\u2019d sailed over the past five months, Goodall was alone.<\/p>\n<p>The 29-year-old British woman had spent three years readying for this voyage. It demanded more from her than she could have imagined. She loved the planning of it, rigging her boat for a journey that might mean not stepping on land for nearly a year. But she was unprepared for the attention it drew\u2014for the fact that everyone wanted a piece of her story.<\/p>\n<p>The thing was, her story was a fantastic one. Goodall was the youngest of the 18 skippers resurrecting the Golden Globe Race, a so-called \u201cvoyage for madmen,\u201d and the only woman. Last run 50 years prior, the race entailed sailing solo and nonstop around the world in a small boat without modern technology. The media were hungry for it, and people were drawn to Goodall in particular: Here was a blue-eyed, blond, petite woman among the romantic mariners and weathered adventurers. All of them were chasing the limits of what humans are capable of physically and mentally, but much of the coverage singled out Goodall, who wanted no part of the sensationalism. She had been a painfully shy child and was a private and introverted adult. The fervor surrounding her participation in the Golden Globe made her feel like a caricature, an unwilling icon. All she wanted was to sail, to search out the connection sailors had with the sea before satellite phones and GPS.<\/p>\n<p>When the race began, she was almost able to leave the attention behind. There were quiet days gliding south in the calm Atlantic; ecstatic mornings surfing swell in the Southern Ocean; the sudden appearance of a magnificent sunset through persistent clouds. But the spotlight tailed Goodall like a subsurface current. Now, after two days of brutal storm, she knew the world was watching to see whether she would survive.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\">I.<\/h2>\n<p><strong>In 1966,<\/strong>\u00a0an English bookstore owner named Francis Chichester riveted the world when he set out alone in a boat to circumnavigate the globe. He wasn\u2019t the first to do so; Canadian-American Joshua Slocum completed the first known solo circumnavigation in 1898, and the feat may have been achieved long before but gone unrecorded. Yet the 65-year-old Chichester chose a dangerous route\u2014one that no one, according to sailing lore, had ever attempted alone: From England he would sail south in the Atlantic, along the coast of Africa to the bottom of the world. There he would pass under the Cape of Good Hope, Australia\u2019s southern coast, and South America\u2019s treacherous Cape Horn before sailing north across the Atlantic again. The remote lower reaches of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic where Chichester would spend much of his voyage are known collectively as the Southern Ocean. The region is a vast field of sea unobstructed by land in any direction, with enormous waves, riotous gales, and dramatic skies. Stories abound about ships meeting their end in the Southern Ocean and heroes enduring impossible circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Chichester stopped only once on his journey, at the halfway mark in Australia, to perform major repairs to his 53-foot boat, which had been battered by three and a half months on the open sea. When he stepped ashore in England nine months after he\u2019d left, he was greeted like a rock star. Queen Elizabeth II knighted him nearly on the spot. Meanwhile, fellow seafarers understood that, after Chichester\u2019s feat, one great ocean challenge remained: sailing solo around the world without stopping. No one knew if a boat could stand up to 30,000 uninterrupted miles at sea, or what might happen to a human mind so long without company. Nine different men decided to find out.<\/p>\n<p>They ranged from a former British submarine commander to storied French and Italian sailors to thrill seekers with little seagoing experience. GPS hadn\u2019t been invented, satellite communications and solar panels were scarcely commonplace, and computing had yet to transform weather forecasting. So the men would sail with the accessible technology of the era: a radio, a windup chronometer, and a barometer. They would catch rain for fresh water and navigate with a sextant and the stars.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Sunday Times<\/em>\u00a0decided to brand the men\u2019s individual attempts a formal race, announcing the Golden Globe in March 1968. The event had virtually no requirements or regulations, as the competitors were already planning their voyages, each with its own launch date. But in offering a trophy for the first man to complete the challenge\u2014to incentivize urgency\u2014and a cash prize for the fastest time\u2014to incentivize competition\u2014<em>The<\/em>\u00a0<em>Times<\/em>\u00a0instantly created one of the greatest adventure stories in history.<\/p>\n<p>Only one man finished the race. Twenty-nine-year-old Brit Robin Knox-Johnston\u2019s heavy, 32-foot boat\u00a0<em>Suhaili<\/em>\u00a0had been considered a long shot. During the voyage,\u00a0<em>Suhaili<\/em>\u2019s water tanks polluted, her sails tore, and the self-steering\u2014a primitive autopilot system consisting of a wind vane that attached to the boat\u2019s rudder\u2014fell apart. The radio malfunctioned two and a half months in; Knox-Johnston had no way of calling for help should trouble have arisen. He jumped overboard multiple times to perform underwater repairs, once shooting a circling shark before diving in. While rigging near impossible fixes to his equipment, he splashed battery acid in his eye and stitched his mustache to a sail while repairing it. When against all odds he reappeared in the harbor of Falmouth on April 22, 1969, after nearly a year at sea, Knox-Johnston sailed into legend.<\/p>\n<p>The other eight competitors sank, abandoned the journey, or worse. Alex Carozzo bowed out in Portugal, vomiting blood from a peptic ulcer. John Ridgway surrendered to intense loneliness and a poorly constructed boat, exiting the race near Brazil. Nigel Tetley barely survived 80-foot waves in the Southern Ocean, only to have his boat sink a thousand miles from the finish. A storm destroyed Bill King\u2019s mast, and he ended his journey in Cape Town. Favored winner Bernard Moitessier, a sea mystic who practiced yoga naked on deck, was well in the lead after passing Cape Horn. But, imagining the glare of the international spotlight that surely awaited him, he used a slingshot to hurl a message onto the deck of a passing ship, informing the world that he was abandoning the race \u201cto save my soul,\u201d and continuing on to the tropics.<\/p>\n<p>And then there was Donald Crowhurst. He sailed slow circles around the Atlantic in his rushed build of a leaky boat, transmitting fake radio reports of progress in hopes of fooling the world into believing he was winning. His log told the story of a man slowly going insane under the pressures of deception and monstrous debt to his sponsor, until his transmissions went silent. His trimaran was later found floating on the waves, its skipper having slipped into the ocean in an apparent suicide.<\/p>\n<p>It would be half a century before anyone attempted the Golden Globe again.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-full largepic\">\n<p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_33519\" style=\"width: 2370px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-33519\" class=\"jetpack-lazy-image jetpack-lazy-image--handled wp-image-33519\" src=\"https:\/\/magazine.atavist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/atsail_map_e-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2360\" height=\"1470\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-33519\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kate Francis\/Brownbird Design<\/p><\/div><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Susie Goodall\u2019s father<\/strong>\u00a0was obsessed with the sea first. Stephen Goodall learned to sail as a teenager and taught his Danish wife, Birgitte Howells, to sail too. \u201cSailing is one of those things where people either have a yearning to get back on the water, or they have no particular desire to,\u201d he told me.<\/p>\n<p>Susie and her older brother, Tim, began sailing and racing small boats on a lake near where they grew up outside Birmingham. In 2004, when Goodall was 15, English sailor Ellen MacArthur set out to break the record for fastest nonstop solo circumnavigation; Susie and Tim followed her journey. After that, Susie read countless books about single-handed sailing and the noble explorers, salty adventurers, and sages who entered into a relationship with the sea as if it were a living thing. Maybe one day she, too, would sail around the world.<\/p>\n<p>When Susie was 17, she told her parents she wanted to attend university, and they took her to visit several campuses. One day she announced, \u201cI\u2019m not going to go to university. I\u2019m going to the Isle of Wight to become a sailing instructor.\u201d Yes, her father thought. That\u2019s what she should be doing.<\/p>\n<p>Susie got her instruction certificates and taught sailing courses. She also worked on superyachts, delivering boats to port for their wealthy owners or crewing them while the owners were on board. She loved long ocean passages and taking night watches to memorize the patterns of the stars. But the yachts were so mechanized that her work felt like operating a computer. She marveled at stories of sailors once keenly in tune with the ocean and the boats they helmed: Ancient Polynesians, for instance, found their way by swell direction and the flight patterns of certain birds. She taught her students celestial navigation, but there was always backup\u2014a GPS or their smartphone could be turned on at any time.<\/p>\n<p>Susie voyaged to Iceland, Greenland, Svalbard, and the Baltic, and rose through the ranks of instructors and crew to become a skipper, the small-boat equivalent of a ship captain, in an overwhelmingly male industry. Still, she doubted her abilities. She rarely felt pressured by her crewmates to prove her worth, but that hardly mattered; with few female role models to look to, her internal critic was more than happy to pick up the slack. Susie found herself wondering: Am I smart enough or strong enough? Am I good enough to do this job?<\/p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t help when, in her early twenties, she voiced her dream of sailing around the world to her boyfriend. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou can\u2019t sail around the world by yourself.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote center\"><p>Susie read countless books about single-handed sailing and the noble explorers, salty adventurers, and sages who entered into a relationship with the sea as if it were a living thing.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>In July 2015,\u00a0<\/strong>Goodall, then 25, was teaching in Iceland when one of her crewmates mentioned that a rerun of the Golden Globe was in the works. When her boat came ashore, she used a computer in her tiny hotel to look up the details. And there it was: The race was set to launch in 2018, the 50th anniversary of the original voyage. Don McIntyre, a decorated Australian adventurer who\u2019d grown up idolizing Robin Knox-Johnston, was masterminding the event. On the edge of 60, McIntyre knew that if he didn\u2019t re-create his hero\u2019s journey now, he never would. And if he wanted to do it, he figured a few others might, too.<\/p>\n<p>Boats would be limited to the same class as the intrepid\u00a0<em>Suhaili<\/em>, between 32 and 36 feet. Sailors would have to navigate with paper charts and sextant, catch rain for water, handwrite their logs, and communicate by radio. No outside assistance would be allowed: no physical contact with anyone else, no help with repairs, no supply deliveries. The specifications couldn\u2019t have been more different than those of the only other solo, nonstop, round-the-world race on offer, the Vend\u00e9e Globe. That event, which took place every four years, was high-tech, high-speed, and high-cost; the boats alone were worth $300,000 to $5 million. But the new Golden Globe seemed more about the journey than the competition. Goodall downloaded the application and sent in the $3,000 entry deposit.<\/p>\n<p>Telling her parents wasn\u2019t easy. She called her mother\u2014her parents were by now divorced\u2014first. Howells knew something was up just by the sound of her daughter\u2019s breath.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Howells asked in her light Danish accent before Goodall could speak.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, nothing, all is good,\u201d said Goodall.<\/p>\n<p>Howells waited.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s this race,\u201d Goodall said. \u201cRound the world. Robin Knox-Johnston has done it before. I\u2019ve applied to join it.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that the race would be nonstop, and run solo without modern technology. She hoped to drip-feed the more worrying details to her family. What Goodall didn\u2019t know was that Howells, on her first sailing trip with Goodall\u2019s father, had read\u00a0<em>The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst<\/em>. The book recounted the original Golden Globe and Crowhurst\u2019s haunting end. Goodall\u2019s mother knew exactly what her daughter would face. And she also knew from her own experience that the sea offered a connection to something greater and deeper, something perhaps beyond words.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you to do something like this,\u201d Howells said.<\/p>\n<p>In the ensuing months, Goodall didn\u2019t tell many people that she planned to sail the Golden Globe. When it did come up, she dreaded a particular question: What made her think she was capable of sailing around the world alone? She had no response to this. It was true that the farthest she\u2019d sailed single-handed was four miles across the Solent, a strait between the Isle of Wight and mainland Britain. Still, she knew she was a strong sailor and could cope with being alone.<\/p>\n<p>In truth, that she didn\u2019t know whether she\u2019d make it was part of the reason she wanted to try. She wasn\u2019t content to merely read about the size of the Southern Ocean\u2019s waves, the ferocity of its wind. She wanted to feel those forces, face them on her own. Only then would she know what she was capable of.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote center\"><p>Sailors would have to navigate with paper charts and sextant, catch rain for water, handwrite their logs, and communicate by radio. No outside assistance would be allowed.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Interest in the new Golden Globe<\/strong>\u00a0came fast and heavy. Dozens of people wanted to run it. McIntyre eventually sacrificed his own entry to devote himself to overseeing such a large event and securing the necessary funding.<\/p>\n<p>The first meeting of participants was held in London in December 2015. There Goodall was introduced to Barry Pickthall, a former yachting correspondent for\u00a0<em>The Times\u00a0<\/em>who had written dozens of books on sailing. McIntyre had enlisted Pickthall to publicize the race in hopes of gaining a major sponsor. Pickthall was a teenager when Knox-Johnston went around the world, and remembered following the voyage. Of the rerun, he said, \u201cIn the end we had 18 starters, with 18 different reasons for going, and very few had aspirations to win it. That wasn\u2019t what they were doing it for at all. They wanted to prove something to themselves, to other people, or just do something they\u2019d always dreamed about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In Goodall, Pickthall saw a golden opportunity. Indeed, Goodall remembered him telling her as much the first time they met. He said that having a woman in the race made it more glamorous and he wanted to get\u00a0<em>The<\/em>\u00a0<em>Sunday Times<\/em>\u00a0to feature her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to dangle you like a puppet for the media so we can attract a sponsor for the race,\u201d Goodall recalled him saying. She was immediately put off. During my conversations with him, Pickthall disputed Goodall\u2019s characterization of their meeting, but conceded that he knew she had media appeal. \u201cIt was the sex side of things! Pretty girl sailing around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I made the most of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In\u00a0<em>A Voyage for Madmen<\/em>, a book about the 1968 race, author Peter Nichols writes about the \u201cUlysses factor\u201d in human mythology, \u201cthe lone hero figure in society, the rare character who by his or her exploits stimulates powerful mass excitement.\u201d The archetype encompasses a set of characteristics\u2014imagination, endurance, selfishness, discipline, courage, and social instability. Francis Chichester was such a figure, Nichols writes, as were many of the other original Golden Globe sailors. Goodall didn\u2019t fit the Ulysses mold in many ways. It would be difficult to call her selfish, and although she\u2019s an introvert, she\u2019s socially adept, with valued connections to friends and family. But she was a woman at an unprecedented time of women\u2019s empowerment, when the public was hungry for stories of lone heroines who\u2019d found success in male-dominated arenas.<\/p>\n<p>When Goodall told her mother about what Pickthall had said, Howells was surprised. Back in 1989, when she\u2019d just had her daughter, Howells followed Tracy Edwards\u2019s history-making circumnavigation during the Whitbread Round the World Race. Edwards had worked as a cook in the 1985 edition of the race, and she was treated like a servant or worse. One crew member wrote \u201cFor sale: one case of beer\u201d on the back of her thermal underwear. After that, Edwards refinanced her house to buy a yacht she named\u00a0<em>Maiden<\/em>, and she assembled an all-female crew for the 1989 Whitbread. The media skewered her. Journalist Bob Fisher called the crew a \u201ctin full of tarts\u201d in\u00a0<em>The Guardian.<\/em>\u00a0While other crews were interviewed about experience and strategy, Edwards was asked about packing waterproof mascara and how such a \u201cgorgeous slip of a young girl\u201d expected to raise the millions of dollars needed to participate in such an extravagant race.<\/p>\n<p>Among the journalists lambasting the\u00a0<em>Maiden\u00a0<\/em>crew was Barry Pickthall. In his telling, it was essentially the women\u2019s fault for the things that were written about them. \u201cThey hadn\u2019t done very well in their preparations. We saw all sorts of catfights,\u201d Pickthall told me. \u201cWe said, \u2018How are these girls going to get round the world?\u2019\u202f\u201d<br \/>\nWhen the women<em>\u00a0<\/em>came in third and then first in the first two legs of the race, Pickthall said, \u201cWe were absolutely astounded. Bob had to change his view to a \u2018tin full of\u00a0<em>smart, fast\u00a0<\/em>tarts.\u2019\u202f\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Howells saw how the media had treated Edwards, but that was nearly three decades before her own daughter planned to embark on a similar endeavor. This is a whole new century, she thought. Surely we\u2019ve moved on.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button-red\" href=\"https:\/\/magazine.atavist.com\/alone-at-the-edge-of-the-world-susie-goodall-sailing-golden-globe-race\/\">Read the full story at The Atavist<\/a><\/p>\n",

The Art of Bidding, or How I Survived Federal Prison<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Eric Borsuk<\/em> | <em>The Marshall Project<\/em> | <em>September 22, 2022<\/em> | <em>8,775 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When Eric Borsuk was incarcerated in federal prison with two accomplices, the three friends used self-education to pass the time. They studied on a demanding schedule and evaluated assignments for one another. When an injustice within the so-called justice system separated them, Eric lost not only their companionship but his primary coping mechanism, forcing him to find a new way to protect his mental and physical health during the final five years of his sentence. In this incisive piece at\u00a0<em>The Marshall Project<\/em>\u00a0(published in partnership with\u00a0<em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vqronline.org\/essays-articles\/2022\/09\/bidders-din?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\">VQR<\/a><\/em>), Borsuk recounts how the justice system\u2019s willful blindness and casual cruelty helped inspire him to write. <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiebound.org\/book\/9781684424504?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">American Animals<\/a><\/em>, the memoir Borsuk wrote from his cell, became a major motion picture in 2018. \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kristastevens\">KS<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"has-the-zodiac-killer-mystery-been-solved-again\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lamag.com\/citythinkblog\/zodiac-killer-paul-alfred-doerr\/?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">2. Has The Zodiac Killer Mystery Been Solved (Again)?<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Aaron Gell | Los Angeles Magazine | September 22, 2022 | 6,235 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Bestselling novelist Jarett Kobek believes he\u2019s uncovered the true identity of the Zodiac Killer. His research into the cultural references in the killer\u2019s cryptic letters led him down a rabbit hole and, ultimately, to an eccentric man named Paul Doerr, who died in 2007. But Doerr\u2019s daughter, Gloria, isn\u2019t so sure \u2014 until Aaron Gell suggests that the two of them come together to meet. I\u2019m in no way immersed in the subculture of cold-case websleuths, but Gell\u2019s story hooked me from the start, and it was impossible not to picture the movie version of this piece in my head as I was reading. As Gell shows, the evidence against Doerr might be the strongest yet, especially after chilling conversations with Gloria about her father, her childhood, and their relationship. Even if Kobek is just another amateur detective making this claim, Gell\u2019s piece demonstrates how easy it is to become obsessed with unsolved cases like these. \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cherilucas\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CLR<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gq-magazine.co.uk\/politics\/article\/the-queue-queen-elizabeth?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">3. 14 Hours in The Queue To See Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Coffin<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Laurie Penny<\/em> | <em>British GQ<\/em> | <em>September 18, 2022<\/em> | <em>3,415 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I was 13 when Princess Diana died. For weeks, her death was the dominant force in England \u2014 on every channel, every paper, every face. A soap opera stuck on a tragic loop. My mum took me to London to lay flowers at Buckingham Palace. I remember the plastic cellophane suffocating the dying blooms, glinting in the sun in an expanse that seemed to stretch forever. I remember it being silent. I had picked flowers from our garden, which were now a sad, wilted offering. I was embarrassed putting them down \u2014 partly by the flowers, partly by even being there. Looking back, I am still a little embarrassed; it was strange to be driven by this huge, incomprehensible, national grief. So I appreciated Laurie Penny\u2019s awkwardness in joining \u201cthe Queue\u201d to walk past Queen Elizabeth\u2019s coffin, quick to explain she is \u201cnot here for the Queen; I\u2019m here for the Queue\u201d (and that she is being paid). People have quipped Brits have been practicing for this queue their whole lives, and Penny encounters great stoicism as people settle into \u201cgroups of around seven or 10, and we take turns keeping each other\u2019s place.\u201d Her group is the focus of this essay: An array of characters brought together simply by turning up at the same time, they bond over the 14-hour ordeal with true blitz spirit. I was particularly rooting for 84-year-old John and his wife, feeling horrified when, after 13 hours, an official tried to remove them for being too frail. Reading, I went from chuckling at Penny\u2019s wit to feeling tearful. Not for the Queen \u2014 I would not have joined the queue without being paid either \u2014 but, as a British expat of 10 years, for missing being part of a nation of people who would willingly share such a bizarre experience. A beautiful essay that, for a brief moment, made me miserably, gut-wrenchingly homesick. \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wells_ca\">CW<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"the-magic-of-summer-basketball\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nba\/story\/_\/id\/34678493\/summer-basketball-pro-am?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">4. The Magic of Summer Basketball<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><em>Hanif Abdurraqib<\/em> |\u00a0<em>ESPN<\/em>\u00a0| <em>September 28, 2022<\/em> | <em>8,314 words<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve only read Hanif Abdurraqib\u2019s peerless arts criticism and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gq.com\/story\/stephen-curry-february-cover-profile?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\" aria-expanded=\"false\">occasional profile work<\/a>, you may not be aware how deeply he loves the game of basketball. (Or how stoically he shoulders his own pathos-filled Minnesota Timberwolves\u00a0<span class=\"p2-glossary-item\">fandom<\/span>.) But that love suffuses every word of his journey into the world of summer hoops leagues \u2014 those offseason battlegrounds where promising young draftees go up against hometown legends and NBA icons alike, in tiny jam-packed gyms that amplify the game\u2019s visceral swells beyond imagination. This is more than a travelogue. It\u2019s a paean to the forge of competitive pro-am basketball, a tradition that sharpens games and shapes folklore. \u201cThe court is home,\u201d he writes of Columbus\u2019 Kingdom Summer League. \u201cIt transcends the places you live, or have lived. If you were made in this city, you can come back and play in this city, and there will be people who remember you when you first made a name for yourself. In a city like Columbus, if you were great once on these courts, you can always exist in a space beyond fading memories.\u201d \u2014<a style=\"font-size:19px;\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/provenself\">PR<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"i-do-not-keep-a-diary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/astra-mag.com\/articles\/i-do-not-keep-a-diary\/?src=longreads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noreferrer noreferrer\">5.

Maybe. He carries a notebook and pen, ready for the precise set of planting conditions that would allow him to sow his thoughts and ideas. The notebook is well traveled. The cover is worn, yet the inside remains blank as he struggles with how to portray himself on the page, asking \u201cHow would I like to appear when it is only myself who is looking?\u201d I loved this piece because I find it wholly relatable. Have you ever felt those sweet yet rare moments when you\u2019re infused with possibility, that desire to make sense of your life and your experiences, to uncover meaning in how you spend your days? Have you ever aspired to get thoughts down before they evaporate, before that drop of inspiration or insight is gone forever? To take pride in yourself as a thinking person who makes reflection a habit? Don\u2019t we all? \u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kristastevens\">KS<\/a><\/p>\n",
