# Networking

Module for handling additional network requests that are not part of the main [WordPress-FluxC-Android] project and its data layer.

[WordPress-FluxC-Android]: https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-FluxC-Android

An example of such additional network requests would be the 'Reader Discover' feature and the 'read/tags/cards' endpoint.
