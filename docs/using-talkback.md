# Using TalkBack

## Prepare for TalkBack:
To enable TalkBack you can: 

- Go to Settings → Accessibility → Screen Readers → Turn on TalkBack.
- You can also press both volume keys for 3 seconds to turn it on and off.

## Using TalkBack:
- When TalkBack is ON, the system will highlight and read an accessibility element on the screen. To navigate these items you can choose either to explore by touch or linear navigation.
- With Explore By Touch, you slowly drag your finger across the screen and any item TalkBack enters gets announced. So Buttons, TextViews, Icons can be selected and once this selection has taking place you can tap to activate the element. A button will perform an action, a switch will get's it's checked state toggled and so on. 
- Linear navigation is also another mode for navigation. When you swipe left or right with one finger you are able to move through each item based on the traversal order that TalkBack derived from the screen. You can navigate using several options such as Headings, Links, Controls or Default(normal traveral order). These options are made available by swiping up or down on the screen.
- If you need to scroll a `ListView` or `RecyclerView`, you can scroll with two fingers and you will hear a sound that let's you know the scroll is being done. Once you have scrolled enough you can then use a single finger to make a row selection.
- If you want to close/go back from whenever you are in an app, you swipe down then left.
- You can stop TalkBack any time by pressing the volume keys together for 3 seconds or by going back to the Accessibility settings..
