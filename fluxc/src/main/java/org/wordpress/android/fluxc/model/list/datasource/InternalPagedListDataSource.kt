/**
 * This component plays the middle man between the `PositionalDataSource` and [ListItemDataSourceInterface]
 * implementation. Whenever a list is invalidated, meaning it needs to be refreshed, a new instance will be created
 * just like `PositionalDataSource`.
 *
 * We first ask the [ListItemDataSourceInterface] for the identifiers of each row and cache them in memory as soon as
 * a new instance is created. This is necessary because `PositionalDataSource` works with immutable values and does the
 * heavy lifting by caching the items in memory as they are loaded, however it still needs a consistent list of
 * identifiers for each index to represent.
 *
 * After the identifiers are cached, whenever `PositionalDataSource` asks for a range of items, they'll be converted
 * to identifiers and propagated to [ListItemDataSourceInterface].
 *
 * Most importantly, by separating this component, we are able to keep a single instance of [ListItemDataSourceInterface]
 * and hide the requirement for identifiers needing to be cached from it.
